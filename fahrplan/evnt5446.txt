The good, the
bad, and the
ugly - Linux
Kernel patches
--------------

Track:
Hardware &
Making

Companies are
often blamed
for not
working
upstream.
Surprisingly,
the situation
is not per se
better with
community
projects. To
change the
latter for the
better,
Wolfram will
show some
examples
regarding the
Linux Kernel
and present
ideas to
create win-
win-win
situations.
In this talk,
some examples
will be given
how Linux
Kernel patches
are handled in
a few great-
for-hacking
projects.
There is great
creativity to
be found and
interesting
lessons to be
learned,
especially
when it comes
to
upstreaming.
The idea is to
create or
encourage
situations
where everyone
wins.
Ultimately,
the kernel
will be
improved, the
project
doesn't need
to carry a
local patch,
the submitter
gains
knowledge and
experience,
and the
development
effort won't
be forgotten
but shared
amongst all.
And there are
already
helpful
inbetween
states on the
way.   Wolfram
will share his
experiences
wearing the
hats of a
Kernel
maintainer, a
commercial
developer, and
a passionate
hacker. And
while Kernel
focused, the
ideas applied
here are
pretty
generic.
