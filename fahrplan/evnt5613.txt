Forbidden
Fruit

Various
dietary
restrictions
are
historically
associated
with human
culture and
civilization.
In addition,
millions
suffer from
eating
disorders that
have both
pathological
and cultural
origins.
Widespread
concern about
food safety
has been
exacerbated by
the
introduction
of genetically
modified crops
and
questionable
practices of
world agro-
business.
Meanwhile,
many common
organic foods
are naturally
poisonous and
can cause
illness and
death if
handled or
prepared
improperly.
The most
poisonous food
imaginable is,
of course, the
forbidden
fruit of the
"Tree of
Knowledge of
Good and
Evil." The
ongoing
catastrophic
and bloody
conflict
between wisdom
and knowledge
has decimated
humanity and
many of its
intellectual
and cultural
treasures. As
a project in
art and
science, an
international
consortium has
been organized
to sequence
the genome of
Malus
sieversii, a
wlid apple
from central
Asia recently
shown to be
the ancestor
of all
domestic
cultivars. A
project to
modify the
Malus
sieversii
genome with a
compressed
version of
Wikipdia is
now underway.
Malus ecclesia
(Wikipedia-
modified M.
sieversii)
will be
planted in
herpetaria and
several other 
sculptural/arc
hitectural
contexts inter
nationally.
