Czech
Parliament via
SMS

A
parliamentary
drama of 223
actors
--------------
Ztohoven

Track: Ethics,
Society &
Politics

The Czech art
collective
Ztohoven'
project "Moral
Reform" was
accomplished
in
collaboration
with web
security
experts.
Together they
created the
unique art
concept of a
mobile phone
mass-hack.
"Am I the only
one who sees
all the bad
things we do?
It`s
impossible to
govern in a
decent way
anymore. Let's
finish it once
for all. I am
ready to
overtake the r
esponsibility.
I am ready to
reveal the
full truth."
Messages like
these were
received by
Ministers from
their
government
fellows.
