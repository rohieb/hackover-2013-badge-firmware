Track:
Hardware &
Making

A review of
the 10 year
history of the
OpenWrt
project,
current
events, and
upcoming
developments.
This year we
are
celebrating
ten years of
OpenWrt and a
long time has
passed and a
lot has
happend since
people first
started
hacking on
devices like
the WRT54G.
Both the
hardware and
the software
landscape has
completely
changed since
then. In this
talk we would
like to take
the chance,
together with
the audience,
to look back
on how the
OpenWrt
distribution
did evolve
over time and
how it has
changed its
goals, its
processes and
its software
stack.  We
will show
examples of
the current
state-of-the-
art, invite
guests on
stage, display
things to
come. And in
general,
celebrate that
10 years have
passed and
that many more
are to come.
The talk will
start by
looking back
into the
ancient
history of
OpenWrt - how
it all got
started -
continue to
the present
time and give
an overview of
current and
recent
developments
and then
finish with an
outlook onto
future
changes.
During the
talk we will
look at the
politics of
what we have
learned, what
we think is
broken in the
CPE market,
and how
OpenWrt can
help to change
this.  OpenWrt
has, over the
course of the
past 10 years,
created a
territory of
its own, a
territory
situated in a
landscape
criscrossed by
relations,
friction and i
nterconnection
s. It is a
journey that
on its way
created an
universal
embedded Linux
operating
system.
OpenWrt is one
of many
islands in the
Net which
thrives by
giving away
its work to
friends,
associates and
all those many
people we
don't know.
All this is a
good reason to
celebrate and
the talk will
finish with
beer, exotic
drinks and
more fun to
come.
