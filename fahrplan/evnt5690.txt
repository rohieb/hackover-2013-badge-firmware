BarbNerdy is
not only nerdy
in finding
great music
all over the
places, she is
also writing
wonderful
stories with
them. . In
Berlin she is
doing since
2009  the very
open minded
and bass music
focussed
Support Your
Local Ghetto
nights at the
lovely Panke
with a lot of
local but also
international
guests.  She
started DJ'ing
in 1990,
worked with
people from
the first
techno
generation
like DJ Hell,
Blake Baxter
or Abe Duque
but already in
1996 she got
bored of the
4/4 and jumped
out of this
strict costume
and enjoyed
even more new
music before
this hits the
mainstream.
Music and
bringing music
to the people
is her biggest
passion. Give
her a good
sound system
and she will
guide you
through a
unforgettable
journey of
music.
