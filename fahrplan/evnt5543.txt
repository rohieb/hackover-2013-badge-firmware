Imagine
getting pulled
over for
running a stop
sign and
learning for
the first time
- from the cop
- that you are
HIV-positive.
People in
China are
required to
carry
electronic,
swipeable ID
cards that
hold their
political
views, their
HIV status,
their mental
health
situation, and
much more.
We'll examine
the history of
these cards,
where the data
is housed, who
can access it,
what vulnerabi
lities might
exist in this
system, what
can be done
about it, and
what it means
for human
rights.
