Track:
Security &
Safety

This talk will
discuss a case
in which
criminals
compromised
and robbed an
ATM by
infecting it
with specially
crafted
malware. The
successful
compromise of
an ATM can
easily result
in the loss of
several
hundred
thousand
dollars.  Most
automated
teller
machines
(ATMs) run
regular
Windows
systems and
can be
controlled
like any other
computer. The
first public
demonstration
of an ATM hack
was given in
2010 - but how
bad is this
threat really?
It turns out
there is a
multi-million
dollar
business
behind ATM
hacks. This
talk reveals
how these
criminal gangs
operate by
disclosing
information
obtained
through
forensic
analysis of a
real
compromise.
In the
analyzed case
some malware
was used to
control the
hacked machine
that was
written
specifically
for the
targeted ATM
brand. By
reverse-
engineering
this malware,
we gained
unique
insights into
the
technologies
used by the
intruders. The
malicious
features range
from balance
monitoring
over cash-out
commands to
the wiping of
the machine to
cover up
traces of the
attack. They
can be
accessed
through
special number
codes that are
entered
directly via
the machine's
number pad.
Hooking
techniques and
overlay
windows are
used to
display the
status of the
system on the
ATM monitor.
We will
further
discuss that
operations of
this scale can
only be
performed by
professional
crime groups
that not only
have the
technical
capabilities
to develop
such special
malware, but
also have
access to
insider
information
about the
design of ATMs
and who know
how the
targeted banks
operate.
