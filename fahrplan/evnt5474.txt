The use of
encryption to
secure
sensitive data
from
unauthorized
eyes is as old
as human
communication
itself. Before
the relatively
new method of
computerized
encryption
software
converting
data into a
format
unintelligible
to anyone
lacking the
necessary key
for its
decryption,
for a long
time there was
pen and paper
and the human
brain doing
quite a bit of
work. Up until
the 20th
century
encryption had
to be done
literally by
hand, to then
be transmitted
in paper form,
via telegraphy
or radio. In
this context,
encryption of
data has
always been of
special
importance
during times
of political
conflict and
war;
subsequently,
it saw its
major
developments
during those
times in
history. This
talk will
examine and
explain common
hand
encryption
methods still
employed today
using the
example of one
very
successful
Soviet
espionage
group
operating in
Japan in the
1930s and
1940s: the spy
ring centered
around Richard
Sorge,
codenamed
"Ramsay".  In
the summer of
1938, the
Japanese
Secret Police
started to
notice
mysterious
radio
transmissions
emanating from
somewhere in
the Tokyo
area. These
transmissions,
consisting of
seemingly
meaningless
groups of
digits, seemed
to be directed
towards the
Asian
mainland;
neither the
Secret Police
nor the
Japanese
Communications
Ministry and
the
Communications
Bureau of the
Governor
General of
Korea were
able to
pinpoint the
where and from
more
precisely. It
wasn't until
1941 that
Japanese
authorities
uncovered the
full scope and
meaning of
these messages
- by accident
and at first
disbelieving
what they had
unearthed.
The seemingly
gibberish
radio
transmissions
did indeed
emanate from
the heart of
Tokyo and, as
it turned out,
were received
in Vladivostok
and passed on
to Moscow, to
be presented
to Stalin
himself.
Decrypted,
they contained
vital
information
about secret
German and
Japanese
plans, even
the date of
the German
invasion of
the Soviet
Union. This
information
had been
gathered by
Richard Sorge,
a German
citizen with a
colorful
personality
who had
infiltrated
the small
German
community in
Japan under
the guise of a
journalist and
even gained
the friendship
and trust of
the German
ambassador,
giving him
access to any
information
available
inside the
embassy of
Japan's ally.
In Japan since
1933, Sorge
had built a
spy ring
around a small
group of
confidantes: a
Japanese
journalist
with
connections to
powerful
Japanese
political
circles, a
French-
Yugoslav
communist, and
a German radio
technician,
Max Clausen.
Clausen's
technical
knowledge
proved vital
for the
group's
success: he
was able to
build a
transmitter
and receiver
capable of
reaching up to
4,000 km from
scratch, using
parts
available in
Tokyo shops
without
raising
suspicion. His
radio station
was fully
portable in a
large
briefcase and
assembled in
under 10
minutes.  The
dispatches
transmitted to
the Soviet
Union by
Sorge's group
were written
in English and
then converted
into digits
using a
straddling
checkerboard
and, to
scramble the
content even
more, a book
cipher, using
pages from a
statistical
yearbook as
the key. The
Japanese
authorities
were not able
to decipher
the messages,
Sorge's
encryption
method
remained
unbroken until
Max Clausen
explained it
himself after
his arrest in
1941.  The
historical
importance of
Sorge's
espionage
material
remains a
controversial
issue among
historians;
some call him
the greatest
spy of all
times, some
argue that
since Stalin
did not trust
his
information,
Sorge had
little
influence on
the outcome of
World War II.
Instead of
trying to
settle this
argument, my
talk will
examine the
technical
aspects of
Sorge's work
in Japan: I
will describe
the DIY radio
station used
to wirelessly
transmit his
dispatches
over thousands
of kilometers
and show how
these
dispatches
were manually
encrypted
using nothing
but a pen,
paper, and a
book -
suggesting
that this
method is
still valid
today,
offering low-
tech ways of
concealing
information,
be it private
or politically
delicate
material.
