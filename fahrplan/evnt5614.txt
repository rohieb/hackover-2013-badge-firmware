On Freedom of
Facial
Expression
--------------
artelse

Track: Art &
Beauty

The facial
hacking
research
presented in
this lecture/
performance
exploits a
well known
vulnerability
of the human
nervous system
that it can be
easily
accessed and
controlled by
electrodes
mounted on the
bodies
exterior.
External
digital facial
control allows
for an
unprecedented
exploration of
human facial
expressiveness
and has
unveiled an
unknown
expressive
potential of
the human
facial
hardware.
Perfect Paul
is a sequel to
my (in)famous
Huge Harry
lecture/
performance in
which a
digital
persona
lectures on
computer to
human
communication.
This new
lecture/
performance,
in a highly
condensed
fashion, will
present the
results of my
recently
completed
doctoral
artistic
research
entitled:
"Facial
Hacking: The
Twisted Logic
of Electro-
Facial
Choreography."
Perfect Paul
will
demonstrate in
a live
computer
versus human
showdown the
superior
qualities of
digital versus
neural facial
control.
Perfect Paul,
when performed
for the first
time in
Bilbao, Spain
won the
Technarte 2012
Best Speaker
Award.  -
