"The Pirate
Cinema"
reveals Peer-
to-Peer
information
flows. It is a
composition
generated by
the activity
on file
sharing
networks. "The
Pirate Cinema"
immerses the
viewer in
network flows.
In the context
of omnipresent
telecommunicat
ions
surveillance,
"The Pirate
Cinema" makes
the hidden
activity and
geography of
Peer-to-Peer
file sharing
visible. The
project is
presented as a
monitoring
room, which
shows Peer-to-
Peer transfers
happening in
real time on
networks using
the BitTorrent
protocol. The
installation
produces an
arbitrary cut-
up of the
files
currently
being
exchanged.
This immediate
and
fragmentary
rendering of
digital
activity, with
information
concerning its
source and
destination,
thus depicts
the topology
of digital
media
consumption
and
uncontrolled
content
dissemination
in a connected
world.
