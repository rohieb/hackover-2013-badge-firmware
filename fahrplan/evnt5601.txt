Politics

Jan Phillip
Albrecht is
rapporteur of
the European
Parliament for
the EU's
General Data
Protection
Regulation as
well as for
the EU-US data
protection
framework
agreement.
The European
data
protection
reform will
replace the
existing 27
data
protection
laws in EU
member states
to form a
homogenous
legislation
regarding data
privacy online
as well as
offline.  As
the profits of
many data
collecting
corporations
are at stake,
the European
parliament is
subject to a
storm of
lobbyists
trying to
dismantle
citizens
fundamental
privacy
rights.
