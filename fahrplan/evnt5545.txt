Making

TREZOR is a
hardware
wallet for
Bitcoin. We
identified
security of
the end users'
computer as
one of the
main problems
that block
Bitcoin mass
adoption.  In
order to fix
this issue we
designed a
small easy-to-
use device,
which isolates
the whole
process from
the computer
which is prone
to viruses and
malware. In
this talk we
describe the
main ideas and
concepts we
implemented
and various
challenges we
had to cope
with in the
process. We'll
end the
presentation
with the live
demo of the
device.
