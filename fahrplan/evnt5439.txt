2013 will be
remembered as
the year that
the Internet
lost its
innocence for
nearly
everyone as
light was shed
on the
widespread use
of dragnet
surveillance
by the NSA and
intelligence
agencies
globally. With
the uprisings
of the Arab
Spring where
people raided
the offices of
their regimes
to bring
evidence to
light, we've
seen a
tremendous
phenomenon: a
large numbers
of
whistleblowers
have taken
action to
inform the
public about
important
details. The
WikiLeaks
SpyFiles
series also
shows us
important
details to
corroborate
these claims.
There is ample
evidence about
the use and
abuses of a
multi-billion
dollar
industry that
have now come
to light. This
evidence
includes
increasing use
of targeted
attacks to
establish even
more invasive
control over
corporate,
government or
other so-
called
legitimate
targets.  2013

Everything
transiting our
network
connections is
under
surveillance
to some
degree. It's
also common
for law
enforcement
and
intelligence
agencies to
use exploits
and malware to
infect and
monitor
computers,
mobile devices
and to spy on
networks.
They're able
to bug our
rooms with our
own
telephones,
read encrypted
emails, log
keystrokes -
they invade
the most
personal
spaces in the
very core of a
person's life
with minimal
economic
impact to
their budget.
In this talk
we'll discuss
the nature of
targeted and
untargeted
surveillance,
exploitation
and
intelligence
gathering.
This active
surveillance
is produced
and operated
not only by
governments
but by
corporations
and
mercenaries
that provide
their
intrusion
services to
the highest
bidders who
often have the
lowest respect
for human
rights.  We'll
introduce you
to the players
in the
business of
active,
passive,
tactical and
strategic
surveillance
and the
products they
provide. We'll
also discuss
examples of
specific
attacks on
journalists
and human
rights
activists
worldwide in
the last
couple of
years.
Surprises
won't be
missing.
