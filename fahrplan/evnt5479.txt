NFC technology
is becoming
more and more
relevant in
our lives. One
of its major
uses is in
ticketing
solutions.
However, most
of companies
use bad implem
entations of
NFC
technology. By
this talk we
will explain a
complete
solution,
analyzing
security
challenges and
outlining the
best practices
and
implementation
choices.  Most
of NFC
ticketing
solutions are
based on
MIFARE
ULTRALIGHT
chips. The
main topic of
our talk is
why and how
these implemen
tations are
vulnerable.
The whole talk
will be
divided in two
main sections:
The first one
we're going to
deal with is
about the vuln
erabilities
which may
occur if you
do not pay
enough
attention to
security
topics. We're
focusing on 3
areas in which
frauds are
possible:  I.
Bad use of GPS
and internet
protocol to
apply fees.
II. Correct
use of OTP
sector in
ULTRALIGHT
chips. III.
Correct data
stamping on
tickets.   In
the second
part we will
show a proof
of concept of
a validation
machine which
uses a secure
way to
validate
tickets. The
machine is
based on an
Arduino Uno
device, and
we're going to
use MIFARE
ULTRALIGHT as
kind of NFC
chips to keep
the whole
solution low
cost.  All
source code
will be made
available as
opensource
just after the
talk to let
everyone use
it to create
secure
solutions in
the world.
