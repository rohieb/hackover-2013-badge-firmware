My journey
into FM-RDS
--------------
Oona Räisänen

Track:
Hardware &
Making

How I
discovered
mysterious
hidden signals
on a public
radio channel
and eventually
found out
their meaning
through
hardware
hacking,
reverse
engineering
and little
cryptanalysis.
A story about
my experiences
with FM-RDS
(Radio Data
System), a
digital
subcarrier
embedded in FM
broadcast
transmissions,
and also
cryptanalysis
of the weakly
encrypted TMC
traffic
messages
contained
therein.  I
originally
found about
the existence
of such
transmissions
in a
roundabout
way, by using
a spectrum
analyzer
program to
examine interm
odulation
distortion in
my radio's
Line Out
audio. As it
turned out,
the inaudibly
quiet
distortion,
probably
caused by the
radio's stereo
demuxer
circuitry,
contained all
the
information
needed to
decode all RDS
data present
in the
transmission.
I will
demonstrate
the journey I
took and give
a short
introduction
to how the
data is
actually
encoded. Live
acquisition of
local RDS data
depending on
signal
conditions in
the premises.
As a bonus,
I'm
introducing
yet another
little-known
FM subcarrier
called DARC,
and my recent
reverse
engineering of
the bus stop
display radio
protocol used
in Helsinki.
