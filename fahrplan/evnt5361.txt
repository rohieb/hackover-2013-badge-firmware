Track: Ethics,
Society &
Politics

This talk will
focus on
responsible
disclosure
best and worst
practices from
both legal and
practical
perspectives.
I'll also
focus on
usable advice,
both positive
and negative,
and answer any
questions the
audience has
on best
practices.
You've found a
security
vulnerability
in someone
else's
product. What
now? You want
to report your
finding so
users can
protect
themselves, or
so the vendor
can repair
their product,
or so you as a
researcher can
give your talk
or publish
your paper.
But how? You
don't want to
get sued! You
don't want to
go to jail!
You don't want
your talk
cancelled! You
don't want to
lose your job!
In my role as
a lawyer at
the EFF on the
Coders' Rights
Project, I
advise
security
researchers,
students,
developers,
and hackers of
all varieties
on how to
report vulnera
bilities. In
this talk,
I'll share
some practical
advice that
will help the
audience
navigate the
legal,
ethical, and
practical
waters that
surround the
disclosure of
security vulne
rabilities.
There is no
one-size-fits-
all approach
responsible
disclosure;
every
situation is
different.
I'll discuss
how to make an
offer of
delayed
publication
not sound like
a blackmail
threat, and
how to draw
the right kind
of attention
to your talk
without
bringing too
much of the
wrong kind of
attention with
it. Finally,
I'll talk
about the
different
kinds of risk
that
disclosure
entails,
including the
types of legal
issues often
faced by
researchers.
Instead of
announcing
rules that you
must follow,
I'll focus on
a number of
practical DOs
and DON'Ts to
help you
minimize the
risks
involved.
