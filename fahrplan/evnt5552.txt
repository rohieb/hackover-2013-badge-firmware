India's
Surveillance
State

Track: Ethics,

India is
currently
implementing
some of the
scariest
surveillance
schemes in the
world. This
lecture will
shed light on
India's
surveillance
industry, its
UID scheme
which aims at
the collection
of all
biometric data
and on various
controversial
surveillance
schemes, such
as the Central
Monitoring
System (CMS).
When it comes
to
surveillance,
the most
mainstream
argument is
that the
majority of
India's
population
lives below
the poverty
line and that
surveillance
is an elitist
issue - and
not a "real"
issue which
affects the
masses.
Given that the
majority of
India's
population has
mobile phones
and that the
Indian
government is
currently
implementing
the Central
Monitoring
System (CMS)
which aims at
intercepting
all telecommun
ications (and
Internet commu
nications),
surveillance
does not
appear to be
an elitist
issue. Given
that the UID
scheme aims at
collecting the
biometric data
of all
citizens
residing in
India and that
most BPL cash
programmes
require UID
registration,
surveillance
appears to be
an issue which
(unfortunately
) affects the
1.2 billion
people
currently
living in
India. And
this is to say
the least.  As
part of the
Privacy
Project, the
Centre for
Internet and
Society (CIS)
in Bangalore,
India, is
investigating
surveillance
within the
country. The
project is
funded by
Privacy
International
and aims to
map out
various forms
of
surveillance
in India,
ranging from
drones, CCTV
cameras and
GPS tracking
equipment to
phone and
Internet
monitoring
gear.   This
lecture aims
to present the
research that
Maria Xynou
has undertaken
at the CIS so
far, which
includes data
on the various
surveillance
technology
companies
operating in
India and the
type of spy
gear they sell
to Indian law
enforcement
agencies. This
research also
includes the
presentation
of India's
various
controversial
surveillance
schemes, with
an emphasis on
the Central
Monitoring
System (CMS)
which
unlawfully
enables the
interception
of all telecom
munications
and Internet c
ommunications.
India is
currently
implementing
the world's
largest
biometric data
collection and
interception
of
communications
schemes. The
aim of this
lecture is to
present
India's scary
mass
surveillance
and to discuss
its
implications
on the right
to privacy and
other human
rights.
