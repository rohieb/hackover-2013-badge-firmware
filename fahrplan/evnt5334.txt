In this
lecture, we
present a
black-box
analysis of an
electronic
contact-less
system that
has been
steadily
replacing a
conventional
mechanical key
on multi-party
houses in a
big European
city. So far,
there are est.
10.000
installations
of the
electronic
system. The
mechanical key
has been
introduced
about 40 years
ago to allow
mail delivery
services to
access multi-
party houses
but has since
then
aggregated
many
additional
users, such as
garbage
collection,
police, fire
brigade and
other
emergency
services. Over
92% of
residential
buildings in
this city are
equipped with
such a
solution.  We
have found
several vulner
abilities in
the new system
caused by the
design,
technology
used,
organization,
and its implem
entation. We
have further
shown that the
new system is
circumventable
with little
costs (not
higher than
the old key is
sold under the
counter).   To
acquire keys
samples we
packed an
active mid-
range RFID
reader with a
battery pack
into a parcel
and send it
via post. On
its way, the
reader
wirelessly
collected the
key(s) of the
handling
personnel.
As a side
project, we
also present
security
shortcomings
in other
access control
systems and
electronic
purse
solutions.
