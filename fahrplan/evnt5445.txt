Virtually
Impossible:
The Reality Of
Virtualization
Security

Errata FTW
--------------
Gal Diskin

Track:
Security &
Safety

This talk will
demonstrate
why it is
virtually
impossible to
secure virtual
machines imple
mentations
properly. In
the talk I
will try to
give an
overview of
the basics of
hardware
virtualization
technology,
the existing
attack
techniques
against
virtualization
and also
explain why it
is such a
complex
problem to
create a
secure
hypervisor.
The talk will
focus on the
low level
interfaces and
how it affects
all aspects of
computer
platform
security. I
will also try
to review a
few
interesting
Erratas at the
end of the
talk.  This

you get out of
this talk you
I hope that
you will
reconsider
your trust of
virtualized
cloud
platforms and
VMM implementa
tions like
XEN, KVM and
VMWare as well
as
virtualization
based
sandboxing
solutions.
The talk will
touch on the
following
subjects /
attack methods
/
virtualization
failures
(among
others):  ?
PCIe  ? SMM as
a shared
component
between VMs
and why it is
dangerous  ?
STM (aka Dual
Monitor) - why
it is never
implemented?
? Shared MSRs
and their
dangers   ?
ISA
implementation
challanges  ?
VT-d / IOMMU
challenges  ?
Memory
configuration,
views and the
complexity of
memory
management
(re-mappings,
PEG, System,
IGD, ...)  ?
MMIO   Finally
the talk will
also cover
virtualization
attack vectors
and
interesting
Erratas.  For
those less
familiar with
some computer
architecture
details -
don't worry.
During this
talk I will
provide a
brief
introduction
to subjects
required to
understand the
technical
challenges
presented.
