This talk will
give an
introduction
on how to
design optical
systems for
space
applications.
As example a
high power
narrow
linewidth
laser module
will be shown.
For various
fields, like
fundamental
physics,
inertial
navigation,
geophysics,
and precision
time keeping,
a deployment
of experiments
in outer space
is highly
desirable or
even necessary
in order to
meet the
stringent
requirements
on stability
and precision.
An approach of
building
ultra-stable
and precise
measurement
setups
includes the
usage optical
systems as in
quantum
optical
sensors or
optical
clocks.  In
addition
optical
circuitry is
as well used
in
communication
systems in
space.
However,
optical
systems on
ground used to
be bulky,
sensitive to
environmental
changes like
vibration and
increasing
temperature.
This talk will
outline the
challenges of
converting an
optical ground
experiment
into an
experiment
operated in
space. It will
name some
specifications
of different
ways of
reaching
"space",
approaches of
meeting these
specifications
and will show
tests to be
performed in
order to
qualify a
system. As an
example the
development of
very robust,
energy
efficient,
micro-
integrated
laser modules
for the
deployment of
cold atom
based quantum
sensors in
space is
shown. These
laser modules
fit on micro
optical
benches not
larger than 80
x 25 mm² and
make use of
either already
space
qualified or
space
qualifiable
components and
integration
technologies.
