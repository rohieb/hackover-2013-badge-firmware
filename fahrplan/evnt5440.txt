Art of the
Exploit: An
Introduction
to Critical
Engineering
--------------
Julian Oliver

Track: Art &
Beauty

In this
lecture Julian
will introduce
projects and
interventions
made by
himself and
others that
foreground
Engineering,
rather than
Art, in the
creative and
critical
frame,
offering
highly public
insights into
the hidden
mechanisms and
power
struggles
within our
technical
environment.
Projects such
as the <i>Tran
sparency
Grenade</i>, <
i>Packetbrueck
e</i> and <i>N
ewstweek</i>
will be
covered in
detail.  Art
has long been
celebrated as
an important
frame for
critical
reflection
upon
contemporary
life. In the
post-
industrial era
however,
complex tools,
formal
languages and
hidden
infrastructure
increasingly
influence how
we
communicate,
move and
remember; now
an
inextricable
part of our
Environment.
<br><br> So it
follows that
to ignore the
languages and
ideas that
comprise
engineering -
from Computer
Networking and
Programming to
BioTechnology
and
Electronics -
is to become
unable to
describe, and
thus
critically
engage, the
world we live
in. While this
presents a
challenge for
the
traditional
artist, it is
one that an
engineer not
working in
service to
science and
industry - a
<i>Critical
Engineer</i> -
is able to
meet. <br><br>

(a wall plug
that allows
the owner to

news headlines

wireless
hotspots) will
be introduced
in detail.
