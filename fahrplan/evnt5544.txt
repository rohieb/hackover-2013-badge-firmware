Sim Gishel is
a multimedia
robot. He
sings and
dances on
request. He
will try hard
to take part
in casting
shows to
become a
popstar.  Sim
Gishel was
born in 2006
in Berlin. Sim
started as a
drawing
machine and
later
performed as a
soloist at
Hermes Opera
until he
decided to
become a
popstar.  In
2013 Sim went
to the Voice
Of Germany
audition.
Unfortunately
they did not
let Sim sing.
"This is a
show by humans
for humans. No
robots." His
biggest
success so far
has been the
performance at
Das
Supertalent
with Dieter
Bohlen.
Unfortunately
the jury did
not choose him
for the live
shows.  Sim
Gishel is
named after a
song on the
fantastic
Confield Album
by the all
time IDM
superstars
Autechre.
