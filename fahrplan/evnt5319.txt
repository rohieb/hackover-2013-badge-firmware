is used to

We all know
monopolies are
bad. We even
have laws
against them
that sometimes
get enforced.
However, today
we have new
kinds of
monopolies
that affect us
without us
even noticing
them for what
they truly
are. And
technology
plays a
central role.
When we look
at social
networks we
see them
usually as a
single market,
maybe divided
between full-
blown ones and
microblogs.
Thus we see
Facebook and
Google+
competing on a
single market
that seems to
be divided
between many
players,
including a
small slice
for Diaspora,
for example.
Competition
only works
where there is
a real
possibility to
choose a
product or
service. For
example,
competition
between family
car makers
works, because
customers can
actually
choose
different
family cars
and yet be
able to travel
to the same
places on the
same roads,
and using the
same kinds of
fuels.
Similarly,
competition in
areas of web
browsers and
e-mail
providers
works because
regardless of
which web
browser you
choose or with
which e-mail
provider you
set-up your
account, you
will be able
to access the
whole web and
to contact
users of all
other
providers.
This, however,
is not the
case with
closed social
networks.
Facebook users
cannot contact
Google+ users
and vice-
versa.
Technically,
from users'
perspective,
Facebook and
Google+ are
actually
separate
markets, each
of those with
a single
monopolist
provider
(Facebook and
Google,
respectively).
Once we start
seeing technom
onopolies for
what they are,
we can start
exploring
their
consequences,
in the same
terms we
consider
consequences
of any other
kind of
monopoly on
any other
market.
