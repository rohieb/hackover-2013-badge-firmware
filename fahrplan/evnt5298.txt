This talks
introduces
programming
concepts and
languages for
parallel
programming on
accelerator
cards.
Curious about
the buzz
around these
graphic cards?
Ever heard of
a Xeon Phi?
Let's talk
about them! In
my talk, I
will introduce
data- and
task-based
parallelism on
multi cores as
a basis. The
well-known
standards
mentioned here
will be OpenMP
and OpenMPI.
And then I
will show you
the  hardware-
close
programming
languages CUDA
and OpenCL. I
will also
mention
OpenACC and
C++AMP as one
possible way
towards more
abstraction
and better
code maintaina
bility. All of
them allow to
program
accelerator
cards with or
without some
safeguards in
place. But
because every
accelerator
card is
different in
how to reach
its maximum
speed, I will
also cover
some
fundamental
card
architectures
and their
pitfalls.  At
the end of the
talk, you will
be able to map
your problem
to one (or
both) of the
parallelism
concepts, have
a first idea
how to get
started ...
and if it is
worth the
work.  Looking
forward to
seeing you
there!
