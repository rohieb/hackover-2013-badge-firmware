Based on her
own
experiences as
an
Intelligence
Officer for
MI5 (the UK
domestic
security
service) and a
whistleblower,
Annie Machon
will talk
about the
relationships
between the
wars on
'terror',
drugs, whistle
blowers, and
the internet,
and suggest
some ideas
about what we
can do.
Drawing on her
experiences as
an MI5
intelligence
officer-
turned-
whistleblower
who had to go
on the run
around Europe,
as well as her
current work
as a writer,
commentator,
and a Director
of Law
Enforcement
Against
Prohibition,
Annie will be
discussing the
four current
global wars:
on terror,
drugs,
whistleblowers
and the
internet, and
suggesting
ways that we,
as concerned
citizens, can
resist.  After
World War 2
the peoples of
the world,
collectively
reeling from
the violence
and barbarity,
drew up the
Universal
Declaration of
Human Rights.
This is a high
water mark in
civilisation.
Since then, at
least in the
west, we have
enjoyed an
unprecedented
degree of
freedom and
prosperity. In
the subsequent
decades
further
victories were
won around
equal rights
on issues of
race, gender,
or sexuality.
By the 1990s
peace appeared
to be breaking
out around the
world, the
Cold War was
over, and we
all lived in
an
increasingly
connected,
globalised
village. Or
did we....
President
Eisenhower
coined the
phrase "the
military-
industrial
complex". He
recognised
that conflict
was good for
business, and
this had
implications
for future
security. He
was prescient.
After the
racial war was
won in the
USA, they
announced the
"war on drugs"
which has disp
roportionately
hit ethnic
communities in
America; as
the Soviet
threat
receded, so
the Islamist
threat came to
prominence;
and as the
free flow of
information
spread over
the internet,
so the fight-
back began
with the
copyright
wars,
surveillance,
and the
crackdown on
whistleblowers
and
organisations
such as
Wikileaks. We
are now facing
the "military-
security
complex" and
an unending,
if nebulous,
war on
concepts.
What can we do
about it?
