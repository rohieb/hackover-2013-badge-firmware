The <a href="h
ttp://www.ardu
guitar.org">Ar
duGuitar</a>
is an electric
guitar with
<i>no physical
controls,</i>
i.e. no
buttons or
knobs to
adjust volume,
tone or to
select the
pickups. All
of these
functions are
performed
remotely via a
bluetooth
device such as
an Android
phone, or via
a dedicated
Arduino
powered
blutetooth
footpedal. The
musician still
plucks the
strings, of
course! This
talk will give
an overview of
the technology
and
particularly
the voyage
that took me
from nearly no
knowledge
about anything
electronic to
enough know-
how to make it
all work.I
will explain
what I learned
by
collaborating
on forums,
with
Hackerspaces
and with
component
providers:
"How to ask
the right
questions."
The guitar
with its
Arduino
powered
circuit and an
Android tablet
will be
available for
demo; the code
is all
available on
the github <a

github.com/gra

itar repo</a>
with the
