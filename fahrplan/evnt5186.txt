Learning to
program an
FPGA is time
consuming. Not
just do you
need to
download and
install 20 GB
of vendor
tools, but you
also need to
wrap your
brain around
the strange
ideas of
hardware
description
languages like
VHDL. PSHDL
aims to ease
the learning
curve
significantly
and provide
more people
with the
ability to
program FPGAs.
At the 29C3 I
gave two 6
hour workshops
on programming
FPGAs in VHDL.
This was not
an extensive
course with
plenty of
extra
features. It
was a crash
course that
got you barely
started in a
"I will throw
you out of a
plane and
during the
fall I will
not just
explain to you
how to attach
the parachute
to your body,
but maybe
before we
splash on the
ground you
might actually
be able to
open it as
well" way.
Some of the
problems to
learn to
program an
FPGA are
certainly
caused by the
complexity
that is
involved in
thinking HW
vs. SW. The
other problems
however can
easily be
addressed,
such as
providing an
IDE that is
actually
pleasant to
use AND guides
the user
towards
solving his
problem by
meaningful
error message
and helpful
documentation.
You can't do
that with VHDL
because the
language is
too fucked up.
So in this
lecture I want
to propose a
new language
that has a
much better
syntax similar
to C, so that
most
developers
will easily
understand it.
Yet at the
same time it
is very
powerful to
get even
complicated
jobs done.
Additionally,
you will not
need to
install
anything to
start playing
with it.  The
big picture
here is that I
want to create
the Arduino
for FPGAs and
I need your
help to get
there.
