Car!

your dashboard

Almost all
higher-end
cars come with
very beefy in-
car
entertainment
hardware. In
this talk,
I'll describe
how to take
advantage of
an existing
hands-free kit
to connect
your car to
the internet
and script
your dashboard
in python.
The German
company
"novero"
builds a range
of hands-free
kits that are
used in most
modern
Volkswagen-
Group cars.
They handle
the Bluetooth
"Hands Free
Profile" and
A2DP (Audio
Streaming),
but also
support RSAP
(Remote Sim
Access
Profile) -
which means
that they have
their own 3G
modem,
separate from
the mobile
phone. Some of
these kits use
this to
provide an
integrated
WiFi access
point to share
an internet
connection
into the car.
It was found
that some of
these devices
are Linux-
based, with
pretty decent
hardware
specs, running
on modern ARM
processors. A
very flexible
software
architecture,
based on GLib
and D-Bus,
allows to
easily replace
or extend the
existing
functionality
with simple
user-space
programs -
which means
that you can
interact with
the in-
dashboard
screens and
buttons, get
access to
various data
sources like
GPS, and have
an internet
connection.
This talk will
show how to
get root
access on this
hardware, run
your own
software,
present a
python-based
framework for
scripting your
car, with full
dashboard
integration.
With a CAN
adapter, the
module can be
run stand-
alone with a
PC simulating
the car, to
simplify
development.
