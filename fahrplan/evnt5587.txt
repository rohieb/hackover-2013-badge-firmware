Track:
Hardware &
Making

Making a new
control system
for a machine
is often a
slow and
tedious task.
Maybe you
already have a
3 axis stage,
and you
already know
how to move it
around. But
what if you
want to add a
camera and use
it for
position
feedback?
You'd have to
redesign the
whole hardware
layer. I'll
talk about
some ways I've
built
modularity
into control
systems for
machines so
that you can
quickly
iterate on
different
kinds of
machine
systems
without
getting stuck
in hardware
land forever.
This includes
connecting
synchronized
nodes across a
network and
importing
legacy nodes
for things
like, say, an
old pressure
box you found
in the trash
and has rs232
in. Down with
gcode! Long
live machine
control.
