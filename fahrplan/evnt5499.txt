X Security

It's worse
than it looks
--------------
Ilja van
Sprundel

Track:
Security &
Safety

For the past
year, I've
been looking
at the
implementation
of X.org code.
both client
and server.
During this
presentation,
I'll give an
overview of
the good, the
bad and the
ugly.  Since
late 2012 I've
been looking
for security
bugs in X.org
code. Both
Server and
Client code.
In this talk I
will give an
architectural
overview of
all the
discovered
attack
surfaces which
would include:
- client
network
protocol
parser  -
server network
protocol
parser  - data
passed on from
Server to
extensions  -
Shared memory
- parsers    -
ACL's  - ...
I will also
discuss
security
issues found
therein. I
will also
discuss
interaction
with various
developers and
how that
process went.
