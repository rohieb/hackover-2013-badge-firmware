How to Build a
Mind

Artificial
Intelligence
Reloaded

Track: Science
& Engineering

A foray into
the present,
future and
ideas of
Artificial
Intelligence.
Are we going
to build
(beyond)
human-level
artificial
intelligence
one day? Very
likely. When?
Nobody knows,
because the
specs are not
fully done
yet. But let
me give you
some of those
we already
know, just to
get you
started.
While large
factions
within the
philosophy of
mind still
seem to
struggle over
the
relationship
between mind,
world,
meaning, inten
tionality,
subjectivity,
phenomenal
experience,
personhood and
autonomy,
Artificial
Intelligence
(AI) offers a
clear and
concise set of
answers to
these basic
questions, as
well as
avenues of
pursuing their
eventual
understanding.
In the view of
AI, minds are
computational
machines,
whereby comput
ationalism is
best
understood as
the most
contemporary
version of the
mechanist
world view.
In the
lecture, I
will briefly
address some
of the basic
ideas that
will underlie
a unified
computational
model of the
mind, and
especially
focus on a
computational
understanding
of motivation
and autonomy,
representation
and grounding,
associative
thinking,
reason and
creativity.
