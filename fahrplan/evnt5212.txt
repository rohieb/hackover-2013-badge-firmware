DNS, DNSSEC
and the X.509
CA system leak
private
information
about users to
server
operators and
fail to
provide
adequate
security
against modern
adversaries.
The fully
decentralized
GNU Name
System
provides a
privacy-
enhancing and
censorship-
resistant
alternative.
The Domain
Name System
(DNS) is vital
for access to
information on
the Web. It is
thus a target
for attackers
trying to
suppress free
access to
information.
This talk
introduces the
design and
implementation
of the GNU
Name System
(GNS), a fully
decentralized
and
censorship-
resistant name
system.  GNS
provides an
privacy-
enhancing
alternative to
DNS and
existing
public key inf
rastructures
(such as X.509
certificate
authorities),
while giving
users the
desirable
property of
memorable
names.  The
design of GNS
incorporates
the
possibility of
integration
and
coexistence
with DNS.  GNS
builds on
ideas from the
Simple
Distributed
Security
Infrastructure
(SDSI),
addressing a
central issue
with the
decentralized
mapping of
secure
identifiers to
memorable
names: namely
the
impossibility
of providing a
global, secure
and memorable
mapping
without a
trusted
authority,
also known as
Zooko's
triangle. GNS
uses the
transitivity
in the SDSI
design to
replace the
trusted root
with secure
delegation of
authority,
thus making
petnames
useful to
other users
while
operating
under the
strong
adversary
model assumed
by Zooko.  In
addition to
describing the
GNS design,
this talk also
discusses some
of the
mechanisms
that are
needed to
smoothly
integrate GNS
with existing
processes and
procedures in
Web browsers.
Specifically,
we show how
GNS is able to
transparently
support many
assumptions
that the
existing
HTTP(S)
infrastructure
makes about
globally
unique names.
