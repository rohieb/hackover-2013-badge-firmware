Seeing The
Secret State:
Six Landscapes
--------------
Trevor Paglen

Track: Art &
Beauty

Although
people around
the world are
becoming
increasingly
aware of the
United States'
global
geography of
surveillance,
covert action,
and other
secret
programs, much
of this
landscape is
invisible in
our everyday
lives.  The
drone war, for
example, seems
to happen
"somewhere
else" while
surveillance
programs take
place among
the (largely)
invisible infr
astructures
and digital
protocols of
the internet
and other
communications
networks.
Moreover, the
state agencies
responsible
for secret
programs
strive to make
them as
invisible as
possible.  In
this talk,
artist Trevor
Paglen
discusses his
work
attempting to
"see" the
various
aspects of the
secret state.
In examples
ranging from
tracking spy
satellites to
foraging
through the
bureaucratic
refuse of CIA
front
companies,
Paglen will
discuss
methods used
to identify
and exploit
structural
contradictions
in classified
programs which
render them
visible, and
comment on the
aesthetics and
politics of
attempting to
"see" secrecy.
