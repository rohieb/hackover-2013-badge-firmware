The Hacker
Jeopardy is a
quiz show.
The well known
reversed quiz
format, but of
course hacker
style. It once
was entitled
"number
guessing for
geeks" by a
German
publisher,
which of
course is an
unfair simplif
ication. It's
also guessing
of letters and
special
characters. ;)
Three initial
rounds will be
played, the
winners will
compete with
each other in
the final.
The event will
be in german,
we hope to
have live
translation
again.
