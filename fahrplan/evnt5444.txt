Track:
Security &
Safety

HomeMatic is a
good working,
inexpensive
and quickly
spreading home
automation
system
supporting
wired as well
as (partly AES
handshake
protected)
wireless
communication.
The first part
of our talk
deals with
security
issues of
HomeMatic
devices and
their wireless
communication
protocol
called BidCoS
(Bidirectional
Communication
Standard). In
the second
part we
introduce
Homegear, our
own interface
software to
control
HomeMatic
devices.  In
the past few
years wireless
home
automation
systems have
become
increasingly
available as a
good
alternative to
wired systems.
Since wireless
devices are
installable
without
ripping open
walls, it is
now possible
to easily
integrate them
into an
existing
building infra
structure. We
chose to work
with
HomeMatic,
because we
think that
through its
affordable
prices, its
good quality
and its fast
growing
portfolio it
will become
the most
widely spread
wireless home
automation
system in
Germany. In
this live
hacking
presentation
we will
introduce
different
mechanisms to
attack a
HomeMatic
system. We
will show how
to sniff
BidCoS
packets, how
to send
arbitrary
packets in
order to
emulate a
device (e. g.
a HomeMatic
central) and
to control
devices. Some
devices use an
AES handshake
to verify the
sender of a
command. But
not all
devices
support the
handshake and
for many
devices it is
disabled by
default. We
will
demonstrate
several
attacks making
use of this
security
issue. After
the live
hacking part
we will give a
short
introduction
into Homegear.
Homegear is an
interface
software,
which directly
communicates
with BidCoS
devices and is
controllable
through XML
RPC (XML
Remote
Procedure
Call). It is
possible to
fully control
most HomeMatic
devices. We
developed it
to add
features which
are not
integrated
into the
official
system like
controlling
valve drives
directly to
implement
custom room
temperature
control
algorithms.
