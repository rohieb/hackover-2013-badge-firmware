Safety

About a year
ago Nintendo
released their
latest video
gaming
console, the
Wii U. Since
2006, the Wii
has led to one
of the most
active
homebrew
scenes after
its security
system was
completely
bypassed. This
talk will
discuss the
improvements
made in Wii
U's
architecture
and explain
how it was
broken in less
than 31 days.
The talk is
targeted at
those who hack
(or design)
embedded
system
security, but
gamers might
also find it
interesting.
The talk will
consist of
several parts.
First, we will
discuss the
Wii U: what it
is, what makes
it tick, and
how it
compares to
its
predecessor,
the Wii.
Next, we will
cover two
different
approaches
that we used
to attack the
Wii U system.
The focus will
be on how our
results were
achieved
instead of on
what those
results are,
so you can
reproduce the
attacks at
home. Along
the way we'll
describe the
Wii U's
security
architecture.
The third and
final part of
the talk will
cover where to
go from here:
What is
broken, what
is yet to be
broken, things
that still
have to be
done to create
a viable
homebrew
ecosystem, the
balance
between the
effort
required and
the reward for
users and
hackers, and
the potential
upsides and
downsides of
different
approaches.
Basic
knowledge of
embedded
systems and
CPU
architectures
is recommended
for attendees,
although we
will try to
explain
required
concepts as we
go along.
Before and
after the talk
we will also
be available
in the
hackcenter for
those who
would like to
discuss
further
details or
embedded
security in
general.
