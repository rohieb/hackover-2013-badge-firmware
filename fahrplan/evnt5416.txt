A farewell to
a bold
proposal?

Supersymmetry
has been
particle
theorists'
favorite toy
for several
decades. It
predicts a yet
unobserved
symmetry of
nature and
implies that
to each known
type of
elementary
particle there
exists a
partner
particle none
of which has
been detected
up to today.
I will explain
why it is  an
attractive
idea
nevertheless
and what is
the current
situation
after the
large hadron
collider (LHC)
at CERN has
looked at many
places where
supersymmetric
partners were
expected and
did not find
them. Is it
time to give
up hope that
susy is a
property of
nature?  The
speaker is a
theoretical
physics
research at
Munich
university.
His research
focusses
mainly on
superstring
theory (an
extension of
supersymmetry)
and quantum
gravity.
