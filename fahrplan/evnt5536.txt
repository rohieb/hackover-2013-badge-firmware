Long Distance
Quantum
Communication

Concepts and
components for
intercontinal
communication
with single
photons.

Track: Science
& Engineering

This talk
should
introduce the
general 30c3
participant
with several
components of
long distance
quantum
communication.
Quantum key
distrution,
popularized
under the name
quantum
cryptography,
is the widest
known branch
of quantum
communication.
It describes
the secure
exchange of a
secret key in
public,
protected by
physical laws.
Several
components are
necessary to
extend over
long
distances,
which are
actively
researched. An
introduction
will be given
into the
theoretical
and
experimental
requirements
for quantum
communication.
The concept of
the quantum
repeater, with
its
components,
quantum memory
and
entanglement
swapping, will
be discussed
in detail.
