As Internet pr
ivacy/security
professionals
and amateur
enthusiasts,
we are often
asked to give
advice about
best practices
in this field.
Sometimes this
takes the form
of one-on-one
advice to our
friends,
sometimes it's
training a
room full of
people, and
sometimes you
may be asked
to write a
blog post or a
brief guide or
an entire
curriculum.
This talk will
survey the
current
Internet
privacy guide
landscape and
discuss the
perils and
pitfalls of
creating this
type of
resource,
using the
Electronic
Frontier
Foundation's
Surveillance
Self Defense
project as a
case study.
As a result of
the Snowden
leaks, we are
learning more
and more about
the
capabilities
of potential
adversaries
such as the
NSA, GCHQ, and
agencies
within China,
Russia, and
Israel with
every passing
day. With each
new
revelation,
there is
greater
uncertainty
about privacy
and security
best
practices,
especially if
your threat
model includes
a state-level
adversary.
This talk will
discuss the
following
points:  What
resources
already exist?
How should
best practices
change in
light of the
Snowden leaks?
What makes a
good security/
privacy
resource?  How
did the
Electronic
Frontier
Foundation
confront these
questions
while
rewriting
their Internet
privacy guide?
