Design

Track:
Hardware &
Making

This lecture
gives an
introduction
to processor
design. It is
mostly
interesting
for people new
to processor
design and
does not cover
high
performance
pipelined
structures.
Small
knowledge on
VHDL
programming
would be great
but is not
essential. A
very small
processor core
will described
here. Demo:
Create a
backdoor in
the VHDL Code
of a processor
core. Exploit
this backdoor
to get a root
shell in the
linux
operating
system.
Processors are
getting more
and more
complex. Only
a small part
of the hacker
comunity
really
understands
what is going
on in them.
This lecture
introducess
processor
design for the
normal
C/Assembler
programmer.
During the
lecture a very
small self
wirtten
processor core
is introduced.
Mentioned
subjects:  -
why build your
own processor
core -
Instruction
Set

and Logical
Unit - Fetch

Security
Demo:  Create
a backdoor in
the VHDL Code
of a processor
core. Exploit
this backdoor
to get a root
shell in the
linux
operating
system.
