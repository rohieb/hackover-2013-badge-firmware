At Fort George
"Orwell"
Meade, home of
the NSA and
the US Defense
Information
School,
managing the
message of
Chelsea
Manning's
trial was
facilitated by
a lack of
public access
to most of the
court filings
and rulings
until 18
months into
her legal
proceeding.
While Manning
disclosed
approximately
750,000
documents to
WikiLeaks,
only 226
documents of
those
documents were
charged
against her
under the
Espionage and
Computer Fraud
and Abuse
Acts.  Only
now, three
months after
being
convicted to
thirty-five
years in
prison on
twenty counts
(including
seven
containing the
Esionage Act
language), do
we know the
identity of
most of those
226 charged
documents.  Do
you want to
know what put
Manning away
for 35 years?
The truth is
stranger than
fiction.
