Safety

SCADA
StrangeLove
team will
present their
research on
ICS systems
for the second
time on CCC.
Last year we
showed current
situation with
security of
industrial
world and
disclosed a
big number of 
vulnerabilitie
s found in
Siemens ICS
solutions.
Part of vulner
abilities, we
can say most
notable one,
wasn't
disclosed due
to Responsible
Disclosure.
This time we
already know.
We will speak
about several
industrial
protocols and
their
weaknesses.
During this
year we played
with new
industrial
hardware and
software -
this
patitially
brings new "We
don't know
yet"
vulnerability
details.
Moreover,
we'll mention
creepiest bugs
undisclosed
from last
year, tell you
about new ones
and build
attack vectors
from them. At
last, we will
share our
experience in
pentesting ICS
enviroments.
Speakers: Gleb
Gritsai and
