Exploitation
of baseband vu
lnerabilities
has become
significantly
harder on
average. With
Qualcomm
having grabbed
97% of the
market share
of shipped LTE
chipsets in
1Q2013, you
see their
chipset in
every single
top-of-the-
line
smartphone,
whether it is
an Android, an
iPhone, a
Windows Phone
or a
Blackberry.
While almost
all other
current
baseband CPUs
are ARM-based,
Qualcomm has
transitioned
their entire
modem software
stack to their
own DSP-based
architecture,
the Hexagon
architecture.
The
architecture
switch
together with
recent
hardening of
the baseband
stack
introduces
significant
challenges for
exploit
development
which we will
explore in
this talk.
