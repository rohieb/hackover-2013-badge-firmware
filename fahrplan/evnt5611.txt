The versatile
communication
channels are
taken for
granted these
days, but how
do they
influence us?
According to
the paradigm
change of
media research
Bartholl not
just asks what
man is doing
with the
media, but
what media
does with man.
The tension
between public
and private,
online and
offline,
technology
infatuation
and everyday
life creates
the core of
his producing.
In public
interventions
and public
installations
Bartholl
examines which
and how parts
of the digital
world can
reach back
into reality.
Aram Bartholl
is a member of
the Internet
based artist
group Free,
Art &
Technology Lab

Net politics,
the DIY
movement and
the Internet
development in
general do
play an
important role
in his work.
Beside
numerous
lectures,
workshops and
performances
he exhibited
at MoMA Museum
of Modern Art
NY, The Pace
Gallery NY,

Berlin and XPO
