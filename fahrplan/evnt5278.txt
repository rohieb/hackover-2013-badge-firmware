Modern
society's use
of technology
as an
instrument for
domination is
deeply
problematic.
Are instrument
ality and
domination
inherent to
the essence of
technology?
Can hacking
provide an
alternative
approach to
technology
which can
overcome this?
How do art and
beauty fit
into this
approach?  In
order to
understand the
essence of
hacking, it is
important to
first
critically
examine the
essence of
(modern)
technology and
the rationaliz
ation of
technological
development.
Because for
all the
wonderful
things
technology has
given us, it
has also
brought us a
vast array of
instruments
for
domination,
ranging from
nuclear
warheads to
the panoptic
surveillance
state. As a
community that
is so deeply
involved with
technology, it
is imperative
for us to
comprehend
that these
developments
did not come
out of thin
air and that
we have the
choice to
follow a
different
path.
Understanding
Heideggers
notion of
enframing as
the product of
historical rat
ionalization
gives us an
insight in the
relation
between the
objective,
scientific
approach to
technology and
its instrument
alization as a
means for
domination.
Yet it also
highlights the
subversive
potential of
hacker
cultures. The
hackers'
playful
curiosity and
desire to
express
creativity
within the
computer-
imposed
frameworks of
formal logic
has the
potential to
transcend code
into poetry,
reconnecting
techne with
poiesis and
mapping the
road towards
the revealing
nature of
technology.
Hacking has
the potential
to elevate
abstract
technological
mechanisms and
relations
dissociated
from the
individuality
to the plane
of the utmost
concrete and
subjective
images. As the
creative
output of the
hacker both
adheres to the
formal methods
of boolean
logic and at
the same time
challenges
them by
devoiding them
of their
rational
finalities,
the positivist
rationale of
what we hold
to be most
objective can
be turned into
an expression
of the
subject. I
will argue
that this
repositioning
of the subject
provides the
basis for
transforming
the
technological
rationale into
one that is
aimed at
liberation.
