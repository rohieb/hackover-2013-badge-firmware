HbbTV (Hybrid
broadband
broadcast TV)
is an emerging
standard that
is implemented
in a growing
number of
smart TV
devices. The
idea is to
bundle
broadcast
media content
with online
content which
can be
retrieved by
the TV set
through an
Internet
connection.
Mechanisms
that allow the
online content
to be accessed
by the TV set
can be
attacked and
might put the
TV user's
privacy at
stake. The
presentation
highlights
possible
attack vectors
of HbbTV-
capable TV
sets and
introduces
possible
mitigations.
The Hybrid
Broadcast
Broadband TV
consortium
aims to define
a standardized
way on how
content from
so-called
entertainment
providers
(e.g.
broadcast
stations,
online media
providers) is
delivered on
connected TVs.
Starting as a
Pan-European
effort, the
HbbTV
consortium
wants to
create a
globally
adopted
standard for
hybrid
entertainment
services.
Especially
within the so-
called
Declarative
Application
Environment
(DAE) - the
HbbTV browser
- another
standard for
connected TVs
is being
adopted: The
Open IPTV
Forum standard
for Internet
protocol TVs
(IPTV). This
standard seems
to cover the
device-
specific part
for Internet
functionality.
This new
standard in
the
entertainment
industry is
currently
rolled out in
an increasing
number of
countries in-
and outside of
Europe.
Besides
concerns about
privacy, this
technology
also raises
concerns about
security.
Possible
attack vectors
and possible
mitigations
are introduced
in this
presentation.
