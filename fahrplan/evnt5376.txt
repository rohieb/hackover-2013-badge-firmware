This lecture
shall give a
first person
account of how
circumstances
have
dramatically
changed for
actionist art
practice over
the last 15
years. I will
use examples
from my own
art practice
to show the
impossibility
to engange in
digital and
real-life
actionism as
they are
considered
criminal under
anti-terrorist
laws.  In the
past, whenever
we decided to
start a new
project, we
always thought
about possible
legal
implications
in advance.
Usually these
would be easy
to ignore as
these
implications
used to result
in small fines
for public
disturbance,
copyright
infringement,
and your
average
threatening
lawyer's
letter. By
now, anti-
terrorist laws
disable us to
think freely
about projects
and issues
that touch
state
authority and
terrorism,
because
thinking
terror already
consitutes a
crime. Hence
we changed our
strategy and
went into the
underground
with "illegal
art", we have
decided to
publish such
projects
anonymously
and internally
we call them
our "Secret
Projects". We
can never be
connected to
what we
artistically
do in the
underground.
But I will
present the
changing
social habitat
and legal
circumstances
affecting the
production
process for
artists by
showcasing
some of our
key UBERMORGEN
projects and
revealing as
little as
possible about
our "Secret
Projects".
In my talk I
need to call
to attention
the many cases
of self-
censorship
that every
user on the
net takes part
in, the
immensly
negative
effects of
this lemming-
like behavior
and the
reflection of
this downward
spiral in the
revolting
newspeak that
has taken over
the mass media
and the lovely
commercial
social
networks.
Because what
we are
experiencing
right now by
means of a
soft transform
ation, is a
totalitarian
take-over
while the
majority of
the artists
are focused on
career, money
and reputation
instead of
resistance,
subversion and
reflection.
