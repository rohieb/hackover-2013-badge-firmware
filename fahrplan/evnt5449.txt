Security &
Safety

Mobile
networks
should protect
users on
several
fronts: Calls
need to be
encrypted,
customer data
protected, and
SIM cards
shielded from
malware.  Many
networks are
still
reluctant to
implement
appropriate
protection
measures in
legacy
systems. But
even those who
add
mitigations
often fail to
fully capture
attacks: They
target
symptoms
instead of
solving the
core issue.
This talks
discusses
mobile network
and SIM card
attacks that
circumvent
common
protection
techniques to
illustrate the
ongoing mobile
attack
evolution.
The evolution
is exemplified
by new
advanced
attack vectors
against mobile
communication
and SIM cards:
Mobile calls
and identities
are known to
be weakly
protected, but
network
progressively
rolled out
patches to
defeat hacking
tools. We will
discuss - and
release -
tools to
measure
whether these
changes are
effective.
SIM cards were
identified as
a remote
exploitation
risk this
year:
Unnoticed by
the victim, an
attacker can
take control
over a card by
sending a few
binary SMS.
Network
operators
started
filtering
binary SMS and
patched some
of their weak
SIM card
configurations
in response to
vulnerability
research. The
talk looks at
filtering
evasion
techniques and
discloses new
configuration 
vulnerabilitie
s present in
many cards
world-wide.
