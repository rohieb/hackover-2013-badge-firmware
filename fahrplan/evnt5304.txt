Lawful
Interception
is a
monitoring
access for law
enforcement
agencies, but
also one of
the primary
data sources
of many
surveillance
programs.
(Almost?)
every Internet
service
provider needs
to provide LI
functionality
in its
routers.
However, LI
exposes a
larger attack
surface to the
one being
surveilled
than any
router should.
Could this be
a mistake?
This short
talk will
cover the
standards,
devices and
implementation
of a mandatory
part of our
western
Internet infra
structure. The
central
question is
whether an
overarching
interception
functionality
might actually
put national
Internet
infrastructure
at a higher
risk of being
attacked
successfully.
The question
is approached
in this talk
from a purely
technical
point of view,
looking at how
LI
functionality
is implemented
by a major
vendor and
what issues
arise from
that implement
ation. Routers
and other
devices may
get hurt in
the process.
