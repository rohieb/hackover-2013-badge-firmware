Track:
Security &
Safety

As application
security
becomes more
important on
Android we
need better
tools to
analyze and
understand
them. Android
applications
are written in
Java and a run
in the Dalvik
VM. Until now
most analysis
is done via
disassembling
and monitored
execution in
an emulator.
This talk
presents a new
technique to
instrument
Android
applications
executed in
the DVM. The
talk will
introduce the
new technique
in great
detail
including many
small examples
and a whole
attack based
on it. We will
go step by
step to show
you what can
be achieved
using this
technique.  As
