This is a call
for
participation
in a project
aimed to build
up an open
source based
experimental
incubator
which can be
used for
variety of
food, beverage
and bio
hacking
projects
allowing for
easy control
and monitoring
of internal
condition like
temperature
and humidity.
Working groups
will be
established to
develop
prototypes
which can be
easily and
relatively
cheaply
assembled.
Securing
funding and
establishing a
portal to
effectively
share the news
and knowledge
within the
groups and
wider
community will
be major part
of the first
phase.  One of
the basic
devices needed
for
experimenting
with growth of
variety of
microbes for
many different
purposes
ranging from
bio
luminescence
art, magic
mushrooms or
to more
frequently
persuaded food
and beverage
fermentation
is incubator.
Ranging from
the fields of
extreme hard
core bio-
hacking to
traditional
home experimen
tation, device
where one can
easily control
some of it's
internal
conditions
like for
example
temperature or
humidity and
record
corresponding
data is
needed.
Decently
priced well
established
and supported
open source
version is not
available yet.
The aim of
this project
is to
establish
product which
is developed
by people and
groups
interested in
the subject
and which is
shared by the
community
based on the
open source
paradigm and
importantly
continuously
developed, so
upgrade and
update of
future
generations is
secured. The
long term goal
is development
of easy to
assembly kit's
and complete
device which
people
interested in
can buy (from
variety of
entities, open
source).  This
talk will be
"officially"
launching this
project
announcing it
to the wider
community
calling for
participation.
The basic
goals,
budgeting and
concepts for
the first year
or so will be
established
already,
anticipating
participation
of people
interested in,
giving for
sure some
space for
changes
because of new
people being
involved. The
short time
goal will be
to establish
several
working groups
participating
more
intensively in
design of
first
prototypes,
securing
funding for
this effort
and also
building
proper portal
to share the
news on
development.
For more
details check
our pages,
this project
will be quite
intensively
developed in
the next few
months, after
few years of
relative
hibernation.
