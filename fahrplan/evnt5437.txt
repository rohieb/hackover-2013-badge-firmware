Did you ever
feel the need
to be in
charge of your
environment?
We did . A
detailed story
of our
experience
playing with
220VAC and
water to build
an automated,
digitally
controlled
ecosystem. A
place, where
you can be the
climate-
change. Double
the
temperature,
triple the
floods, let it
storm or rain.
A Tamagotchi
that generates
food from
electricity.
All done with
Arduino,
raspberry Pi
and Node.js.
Show and tell
of our food
replicator
project,
filled with
experiences
and lessons
learned about
Node.js
controlled
Arduinos on a
raspberry Pi.
From a web app
down to
controlling
environmental
conditions in
an ecosystem,
by talking
JSON. A
quantified
environment
that
automatically
adapts itself
to the needs
of its flora
and fauna,
driven by
machine
learning.
Aquaponics in
combination
with robotics.
Fish and
plants inside
a machine and
the
Implications
for future
food
production.
