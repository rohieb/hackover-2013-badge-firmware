No Neutral
Ground in a
Burning World

The news of
the past few
years is one
small ripple
in what is a
great wave of
culture and
history, a
generational
clash of
civilizations.
If you want to
understand why
governments
are acting and
reacting the
way they are,
and as
importantly,
how to shift
their course,
you need to
understand
what they're
reacting to,
how they see
and fail to
see the world,
and how power,
money, and
idea of rule
of law
actually
interact.  Our
relationships
with work and
property and
with the
notion of
national
identity are
changing
rapidly.
We're becoming
more polarized
in our
political
opinions, and
even in what
we consider to
be existential
threats. This
terrain
determines our
world, even as
we deal with
our more
individual
relationships
with
authority, the
ethics imposed
by our
positions in
the world, and
the
psychological
impact of
learning that
our paranoia
was real.  The
idea of the
Internet and
the politics
it brings with
it have
changed the
world, but
that change is
neither
unopposed nor
detatched from
larger
currents. From
the battles
over global
surveillance
and the
culture of
government
secrecy to the
Arab Spring
and the winter
of its
discontent,
these things
are part of
this moment's
tapestry and
they tell us
about the
futures we can
choose. The
world is on
fire, and
there is
nowhere to
hide and no
way to stay
neutral.
