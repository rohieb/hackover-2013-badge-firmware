Attribute
Based
Credentials
(ABC) allow
users to prove
certain
properties
about
themselves
(e.g. age,
race, license,
etc.) without
revealing
their full
identity. ABC
are therefore
important to
protect the
privacy of the
user. The IRMA
(I Reveal My
Attributes)
project of the
Radboud
University
Nijmegen has
created the
first full and
efficient
implementation
of this
technology on
smart cards.
This allows
ABC technology
to be used in
practice both
on the
Internet as
well as in the
physical
world. We will
discuss ABCs
in general,
the IRMA
system, it's
advantages and
pitfalls, and
future work.
Attribute
Based
Credentials
(ABC) allow
users to prove
certain
properties
about
themselves
(e.g. age,
race, license,
etc.) without
revealing
their full
identity. They
provide
unlinkability,
both between
issuance of
the credential
and
subsequebtly
proving
ownership of
the
credential, as
well as
between
subsequent
ownership
proces at a
service
provider. This
makes it
impossible to
track a user
as she uses
her
credentials on
the web. This
makes ABCs a
powerful
privacy
enhancing
technology.
Smart cards
are an
appealing
container to
store such
credenentials:
they are
secure, and
can be caried
by the user in
an ordinary
wallet.
However, ABC
use complex
cryptography
to achieve
their privacy
preserving
properties,
thus far
evading
efficient impl
ementations on
such smart
cards. The
IRMA (I Reveal
My Attributes)
project of the
Radboud
University
Nijmegen
(together with
SURFnet and
TNO) has
created the
first full and
efficient
implementation
of this
technology on
smart cards.
The
implementation
is based on
the Idemix
technology
orginally
developed by
IBM. The smart
card is
contactless,
to allow NFC
enabled smart
phones and
tablets as
readers. This
makes it easy
to use IRMA
cards on the
web, or to
prove
credentials in
a small shop
on the tablet
owned by the
shopkeeper.
We will
discuss ABCs
in general,
the IRMA
system and
it's
implementation
particular,
and give a
demo of how an
IRMA card can
be used in
practice
(using a smart
phone as the
card reader).
More
importantly
though we will
discuss the
advantages and
disadvantages
of ABC
technology,
compared to
other identity
management
approaches. We
will
especially
discuss the
risk of having
a ubiquitous
authentication
infrastructure
that ABCs
would provide
when
implemented on
national
identity
cards, and
outline ways
to mitigate
these risks.
