Security &
Safety

The goal of
white-box
cryptography
is to protect
cryptographic
keys in a
public
implementation
of encryption
algorithms,
primarily in
the context of
Pay-TV and
tamper-
resistant
software. I
present an
overview of
the white-box
cryptography
concept along
with the most
common
applications
and proposed
designs. I
discuss the
subtle
difference
between white-
box
cryptography,
public-key
cryptography,
and
obfuscation.
The informal
notion of
white-box
cryptography
was coined by
Chow et al.
2002 as a
method to
protect
cryptographic
keys in a
public
implementation
of encryption
algorithms,
which is fully
accessed by an
adversary.
White-box impl
ementations of
the AES and
DES ciphers
were
presented, but
they were all
badly broken.
Subsequent
attempts were
no better.
Whereas some
theoretical
foundations of
white-box
cryptography
have been
given recently
in Wyseur's
PhD thesis, so
far they have
not lead to
any practical
scheme.  I
present an
overview of
the white-box
cryptography
concept along
with the most
common
applications
and proposed
designs. I
discuss the
subtle
difference
between white-
box
cryptography,
public-key
cryptography,
and
obfuscation. I
try to answer
the question
if the
security of a
white-box
scheme can be
relied on
public
scrutiny in
contrast to
the hardness
assumptions
behind RSA and
other public-
key schemes.
Alongside the
theoretical
results, I
present some
well-known
attempts to
construct a
white-box
cryptographic
scheme from
the AES and
DES ciphers,
and show their
inherent
weaknesses.
Finally, I
discuss some
potential
methods to
construct a
secure white-
box cipher
from scratch
using the
results from
finite fields
theory and
public-key
cryptography.
