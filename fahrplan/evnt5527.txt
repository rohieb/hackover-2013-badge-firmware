Basics of
Digital
Wireless
Communication

introduction
to software
radio
principles
--------------
Clemens Hopfer

Track:
Hardware &
Making

The aim of
this talk is
to give an
understandable
insight into
wireless
communication,
using existing
systems as
examples on
why there are
different
communication
systems for
different
uses.
Although
wireless
communication
systems, like
Wifi, GSM,
UMTS,
Bluetooth or
DECT, are
always
surrounding
us, radio
transmission
is often seen
as "Black
Magic".
Digital
wireless
communication
systems differ
significantly
from analog
system
designs,
although
actuall
transmission
is still
analog.
Digital
modulations,
coding,
filtering etc.
enable highly
scalable and
adaptive
wireless
systems,
making it
possible to
design quad-
band LTE/UMTS/
CDMA/GSM
radios on a
single chip.
The talk
briefly
describes
system
concepts,
modulation and
coding basics,
along with the
challenges of
mobile
communication
systems.
This will
include the
following
topics:
System
concepts
Digital
Modulations
Shannon-
Hartley
theorem
Channel coding
principles
Channel Access
High Frequency
