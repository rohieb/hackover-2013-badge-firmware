A case for
expansionistic
space policy

& Engineering

An abundant
number of
existential
risks
threatens
humanity. Many
of those
planetary by
nature.
Current
science
already
enables us to
colonize
nearby space,
yet nobody
bothers to
supply the
modest
financial
resources.
Hence this
call to
action.
Numerous
existential
risks
currently
threaten
humanity:
Nuclear war,
resource
depletion,
antibiotica
resistant
bacteries,
meteor
impacts,
unfriendly
singulary,
just to list a
few. Various
groups try to
reduce these
risks, a real
effect is yet
to be seen
though. As
those risks
are never
going be
eliminated
entirely, a
safer (and
rather
obvious)
strategy would
be to
distribute
humanity a
little more
redundantly
throughout
space. The
financial
resources
allocated to
this task
however are
ridiculously
small.  This
talk is going
to highlight
<ul> <li>why
it would be a
jolly good
idea to take
space
expansion
seriously
<li>what
current
technology can
already do
<li>what
humanity
currently
"uses" its
resources on
<li>which
political
institution we
should prod
</ul>
