The movement
against SOPA
in the US was
the largest
protest in
online
history, and
as one of the
core
organizers, we
learned a lot
of lessons on
how to build a
grassroots
movement for
internet
freedom.  How
can these
lessons
learned be
applied to the
anti-
surveillance
movement both
in the US and
globally? Can
millions of
internet users
really counter
millions of
dollars and
entrenched
interests on
the other
side? And how
can we
continue to
have our
voices heard
on these
issues?
