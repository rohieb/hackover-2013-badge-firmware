Towards an
affordable
brain-
computer-
interface
--------------
Dominic, Anne

Track: Science
& Engineering

The brain can
be understood
as a highly
specialized
information
processing
device.
Because
computers
basically do
the same
thing, it's
not too absurd
to try to link
these two
together. The
result is a
brain-
computer-
interface.
This talk
explains the
core
functionality
of our brain
and how to
access the
stored data
from the
outside.
Software and
hardware have
already
reached a
somewhat
hacker-
friendly
state, and we
want to show
you how we got
there. We're
also here to
answer all
your questions
about the
brain.
Communication
between humans
and computers
has great
tradition, but
also underlies
several
disadvantages.
Interfaces
like mice,
keyboards or
microphones
essentially
link the
user's body
parts to a
computer. When
creating new
content, these
interfaces
prove to be
relatively
inefficient,
inaccurate and
limited by the
user's skill.
A good brain-
computer-
interface
would take
body movements
out of the
process. Less
required skill
and more
information
flow density
are only the
most obvious
benefits. It
is a potential
replacement
for dozens of
today's
specialized
devices. And,
just as a
microphone
does for
voice, it
would also
allow the
transfer of
visual
imaginations.
Before we
explain how to
create the
most advanced
brain-
computer-
interface
possible
today, Dominic
dives quite
deeply into
the signal
processing
structure in
the brain. He
presents the
most recent
findings in
cognitive
science and
explains what
happens - step
for step -
when we
imagine the
image of a red
ball. At the
end of this
first section,
he arrives at
the level of
electrical
signals.  Anne
then takes
over with the
groundwork
necessary to
capture and
process these
electrical
signals. She
isn't afraid
to use proper
math for a
deeper
understanding,
but she made
sure that her
talk is easy
to follow for
non-tech
majors too.
The foundation
for a
contemporary
brain-
computer-
interface
consists of
several core
algorithms,
which are used
in lab
settings today
and by
enthusiasts
tomorrow. She
calls out the
pitfalls when
dealing with
signals from
live brains,
and covers the
technical
limitations
with crunching
the data.  We
finish with a
real-world
perspective.
The power of
today's
available
hardware and
software is
still limited,
but our
understanding
of
informations
inside and
outside the
brain has
improved
drastically.
We've come a
long way since
electrode-
level pattern
matching, and
we'd be
excited to
show you some
examples of
what's
possible
today.
