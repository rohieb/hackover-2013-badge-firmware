From Stellar
Wind to PRISM,
Boundless
Informant to
EvilOlive, the
NSA spying
programs are
shrouded in
secrecy and
rubber-stamped
by secret
opinions from
a court that
meets in a
faraday cage.
The Electronic
Frontier
Foundation's
Kurt Opsahl
explains the
known facts
about how the
programs
operate and
the laws and
regulations
the U.S.
government
asserts allows
the NSA to spy
on you.  The
Electronic
Frontier
Foundation, a
non-profit
civil society
organization,
has been
litigating
against the
NSA spying
program for
the better
part of a
decade. EFF
has collected
and reviewed
dozens of
documents,
from the
original NY
Times stories
in 2005 and
the first AT&T
whistleblower
in 2006,
through the
latest
documents
released in
the Guardian
or obtained
through EFF's
Freedom of
Information
(government
transparency)
litigation.
EFF attorney
Kurt Opsahl's
lecture will
describe how
the NSA spying
program works,
the underlying
technologies,
the targeting
procedures
(how they
decide who to
focus on), the
minimization
procedures
(how they
decide which
information to
discard), and
help you makes
sense of the
many code
names and
acronyms in
the news. He
will also
discuss the
legal and
policy
ramifications
that have
become part of
the public
debate
following the
recent
disclosures,
and what you
can do about
it.  After
summarizing
the programs,
technologies,
and
legal/policy
framework in
the lecture,
the audience
can ask
questions.
