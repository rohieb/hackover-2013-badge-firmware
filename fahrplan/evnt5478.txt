Law
enforcement
agencies claim
they are
"going dark".
Encryption
technologies
have finally
been deployed
by software
companies, and
critically,
enabled by
default, such
that emails
are flowing
over HTTPS,
and disk
encryption is
now frequently
used. Friendly
telcos, who
were once a
one-stop-shop
for
surveillance
can no longer
meet the needs
of our
government.
What are the
FBI and other
law
enforcement
agencies doing
to preserve
their spying
capabilities?
The FBI is
rallying
political
support in
Washington, DC
for
legislation
that will give
it the ability
to fine
Internet
companies
unwilling to
build
surveillance
backdoors into
their
products. Even
without such
legislation,
the US
government has
started to
wage war
against
companies that
offer secure
communications
services to
their users.
As the FBI's
top lawyer
said in 2010,
"[Companies]
can promise
strong
encryption.
They just need
to figure out
how they can
provide us
plain text."
At the same
time, law
enforcement
agencies in
the United
States and
elsewhere are
acquiring the
tools to hack
into the
computers of
their own
citizens. The
FBI has
purchased
custom-built
software,
while other
law
enforcement
agencies in
the US and
elsewhere use
off-the-shelf
spyware from
companies like
Gamma and
Hacking Team.
Regardless of
the software
they use, the
capabilities
are generally
similar: They
can enable a
computer's
webcam and
microphone;
collect real-
time location
data; and copy
emails, web
browsing
records, and
other
documents.
