Making awesome
stuff with
FPGAs
--------------
Karsten Becker

Track:
Hardware &
Making

In this talk I
want to show
you around in
the mysterious
world of Field
Programmable
Gate Arrays,
or short
FPGAs. The aim
is to enable
you to get a
rough
understanding
on what FPGAs
are good at
and how they
can be used in
areas where
conventional
CPUs and Micro
controllers
are failing
upon us. FPGAs
open up the
world of high-
speed serial
interconnects,
nano-second
event
reactions and
hardware
fuzzing.  In
this lecture I
will present
you the basics
of how FPGAs
work and how
to program
them. I will
also show-case
some tasks
where FPGAs
really shine.
As an example
I will show
how a 200 MHz
FPGA can
perform a
discrete
wavelet twice
as fast as an
2.6 GHz i7. I
will also show
other
applications
where FPGAs
are almost
unbeatable,
compared to a
CPU. At the
end I will
give you an
overview of
the market.
What are
hacker
friendly
boards, which
vendors tool
chain sucks
the least etc.
After this
lecture you
should be able
to decide
whether a CPU,
a GPU or an
FPGA could
solve your
problem the
most
efficient.
