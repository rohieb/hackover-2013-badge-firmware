OpenNews sends
coders into
news
organisations
on a ten-month
fellowship to
make new tools
for reporting
and measuring
the news. We
believe that
to remain
relevant,
journalism has
to smarten up
about tech and
data. As a
global
community, we
develop tools
to datamine
public data,
news apps to
make
information
accessible,
and
visualisations
to break down
complex
stories. In my
talk, I want
to present the
lessons about
tech that I've
learned in a
newsroom and
the things
that still
need to be
built.  The
internet is
destroying the
business of
news. Not only
does the web
make it harder
to sell
advertising on
dead trees, it
also changes
what it means
to investigate
and tell a
good news
story. Scoops
aren't just
researched on
the phone
anymore, but
in scraped
databases or
leaked data
dumps. Yet
most
journalists
are missing
the skills to
access such
information
effectively.
This means two
things: we
need training
for journos
and
collaborations
between hacks
and hackers.
Some news
organisations
are waking up
to this fact:
the New York
Times has an
interactive
team that
employs some
of the best
web
developers,
and the non-
profit
ProPublica has
its own nerd
team working
as data-driven
reporters.
Working in a
news
organisation
requires
coders to
change the way
they do things
and to focus
on telling a
good story,
rather than
building a
beautiful
application.
After coding
on open data
applications
for a few
years, I
applied to
join OpenNews
and to try and
build data-
driven news
applications
from inside a
news
organisation.
After a year
at Spiegel
Online and
visiting news
orgs around
the world,
I've explored
not just the
weird space of
online news,
but also the
kinds of
systems that
we need to
build to
enable
journalists to
run their
investigations
deeper, and to
keep track of
the knowledge
they collect.
