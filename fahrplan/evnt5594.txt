Hardware &
Making

Every
successful
open hardware
project needs
a solid
organization
structure at
some point in
time,
especially
when plan to
produce and
sell your
project. In
our "i3
Berlin" 3d
printer
project, we
took some
elements of
the PLM
(Product
Lifecycle
Management)
concept and
implemented it
with open
source tools
like Github
and Blender.
<h3> Common
project
structure used
in the product
industry </h3>
<p> The
concept of
Product
Lifecycle
Management is
the process of
managing the
entire
lifecycle of a
product from
its
conception,
through design
and
manufacture,
to service and
disposal. PLM
is about how
to handle
versions,
communication
with users,
etc. Every PLM
has to be
tailor made to
the project
and the team
working on it.
PLM is vital
to organize
open hardware
projects to be
more focused
and efficient,
yet being open
and adaptive
at the same
time. Building
a PLM is time
demanding but
will make your
projects more
and more
efficient.
</p>  <h3> Our
experiences so
far </h3>  <p>
Our project is
the i3 Berlin
3D printer, a
remix of the
Prusa i3.  -
It is an elect
romechanical
project that
is mainly
built from
printed parts
and
standardized
sourced parts.
- We don´t
develop
electronics,
but we do
design
mechanical
parts and make
adjustments to
the firmware.
- We also sell
our design as
a kit, which
need a manual
and a bill of
materials that
is always up
to date. -
Furthermore we
have to track
issues and we
want to be
open for
cooperation by
other people.
</p>  <p> We
used Blender
to design the
entire
machine.  -
Blender is a
3D mesh
modeler, where
the industry
uses solely
parametric CAD
software when
it comes to el
ectromechanica
l engineering.
- Parametric
3D models are
smart, where
mesh models
are stupid
models you
modify with
smart tools.
- Mesh
modeling is a
very suitable
method, when
3D printing is
the main
manufacturing
method. Design
files are much
easier to
share among
people and
programs. -
Cables are an
intricate part
of a moving
machine which
can be modeled
well within
Blender.  - We
wrote a plug
in to generate
a bill of
material and
developed a
method to make
a step by step
visual manual
with animation
frames. Both
BOM and manual
are a part of
the design
file and
therefore
these will
always be up
to date. The
rendered
pictures from
Blenders </p>
<p> For
communication
we use Github.
- The core
ideas and
design
requirements
grow over time
in the wiki.
- The submit
structure of
Github
automatically
takes care for
a version
control. - Git
issues work as
a support
ticket system
to track and
solve
problems.  -
Design
guidelines
make sure that
everyone
cooperating
organizes
their work
coherently
with the
project. </p>
<h3> Future
plans </h3>
<p> - make
Blender more
accessible by
making
tutorials
directly
focused on
mechanical
design.  -
connect the
BOM with a
database for
logistics and
price
calculations
and demand
estimation,
supply chain -
continue work
on OHM (open
hardware
management)
toolbox </p>
