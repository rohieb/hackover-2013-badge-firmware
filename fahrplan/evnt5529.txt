Hardening
hardware and
choosing a
#goodBIOS

Clean boot
every boot -
rejecting
persistence of
malicious
software and
tripping up
the evil maid
--------------

Security &
Safety

A commodity
laptop is
analyzed to
identify
exposed attack
surfaces and
is then
secured on
both the
hardware and
the firmware
level against
permanent
modifications
by malicious
software as
well as quick
drive-by
hardware
attacks by
evil maids,
ensuring that
the machine
always powers
up to a known
good state and
significantly
raising the
bar for an
attacker who
wants to use
the machine
against its
owner.
Commodity
computers by
design include
attack vectors
that allow
malicious
software and
attackers who
gain brief
physical
access, so-
called evil
maids, to take
full control
over the
machine
without the
owner ever
noticing.  The
presentation
briefly
enumerates
well-known
attacks such
as remote DMA
over IEEE1349/
FireWire, BIOS
bootkits, AMT
and closed
source
operating
system updates
to arrive at a
problem
statement, and
moves on in
search of
solutions
which can
block the
attacks
completely or
at least
hinder them
from becoming
persistent,
starting a
layer below
them all; with
the schematic
of a laptop
mainboard.  A
few relatively
simple
hardware
modifications
are
identified,
which together
with the
coreboot
#goodBIOS
firmware
prevent two
entire classes
of attacks.
The result is
a machine
which always
powers up in a
known good
state and
which must be
under attacker
control for 20
minutes in
order to be
compromised,
rather than
just 20
seconds.  In
closing the
presentation
starts a
discussion
about what we
can do to
address this
problem, which
exists in
every single
computer on
the market, on
a larger
scale.
