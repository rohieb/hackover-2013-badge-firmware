Side-channel
analysis (SCA)
and related
methods
exploit
physical chara
cteristics of
a (cryptograph
ic) implementa
tions to
bypass
security
mechanisms and
extract secret
keys. Yet, SCA
is often
considered a
purely
academic
exercise with
no impact on
real systems.
In this talk,
we show that
this is not
the case:
Using the
example of
several wide-
spread real-
world devices,
we demonstrate
that even
seemingly
secure systems
can be
attacked by
means of SCA
with limited
effort.  This
talk briefly
introduces
implementation
attacks and
side-channel
analysis (SCA)
in particular.
Typical side-
channels like
the power
consumption
and the EM
emanation are
introduced.
The main focus
is then on
three case
studies that
have been
conducted as
part of the
SCA research
of the Chair
for Embedded
Security
(Ruhr-Uni
Bochum) since
2008:  The
first example
are FPGAs that
can be
protected
against
reverse-
engineering
and product
counterfeit
with a feature
called
"bitstream
encryption".
Although the
major vendors
(Xilinx and
Altera) use
secure ciphers
like AES, no c
ountermeasures
against SCA
were
implemented.
As a second
example, a
wide-spread
electronic
locking system
based on
proprietary
cryptography
is analyzed.
The target of
the third case
study is a
popular one-
time password
token for two-
factor authent
ication, the
Yubikey 2.  In
all three
cases, the
cryptographic
secrets could
be recovered
within a few
minutes to a
few hours of
measurements,
allowing an
adversary to
decrypt FPGA
bitstreams, to
clone
Yubikeys, and
to open all
locks in an
entire
installation,
respectively.
In conclusion,
we summarize
possible count
ermeasures
against the
presented
attacks and
describe the
communication
with the
respective
vendors as
part of a
responsible
disclosure
process.
