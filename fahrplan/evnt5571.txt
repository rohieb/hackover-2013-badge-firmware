Calafou - the
Ecoindustrial
Postcapitalist
Colony - is a
settlement of
around three
dozen people
in the
Catalonian
countryside.
Concrete
pylons
standing 20
meters high
hold a highway
passing above
the wild
forest valley,
where hall
after
dilapidated
hall of
industrial
ruins stretch
along the
banks of a
contaminated
stream
nurturing a
twisted yet
lively
ecosystem.
Echoes of
unseen,
passing cars
blend into the
organic static
of wildlife,
punctuated by
beats booming
from the
hacklab
speakers.
Dubbed The
Hacker
Monastery by
some, this 3
years old
effort aims to
create a node
in a self-
sustaining
network of
cooperatives
called
Cooperativa
Integral
Catalana,
developed at
the site of a
13th century
factory which
was itself an
industrial
experiment,
and builds on
the local
traditions of
self-
organisation
and autonomy.
Not to be
confused with
ecovillages,
Calafou has a
strong
technological
focus, ranging
from software
and hardware
development
through
permaculture
to crafts
based on
recycling and
local
materials.
While we are
concentrating
on creating
and
strenghtening
local infrastr
uctures,
Calafou is not
a self-
enclosed
entity but a
constructive
and sometimes
combative
participant in
an extensive
array of
compatible
projects, a
mutated plague
infecting even
the mainstream
society which
is already
ridden with
opressive
institutions.
