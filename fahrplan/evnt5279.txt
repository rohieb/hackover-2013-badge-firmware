You might
remember
Tamagotchi
virtual pets
from the
1990's. These
toys are still
around and
just as
demanding as
ever! At 29C3,
I talked about
my attempts to
reverse
engineer the
latest
Tamagotchis,
and this
presentation
covers my
progress since
then. It
includes
methods for
executing code
on and dumping
code from a
Tamagotchi, an
analysis of
the Tamagotchi
code dump and
a
demonstration
of Tamagotchi
development
tools that
make use of
these
capabilities.
Recent
Tamagotchis
are more than
just pets.
They can talk
to their
friends over
IR, support
games on
external ROMs
and store
generations
worth of
information
about their
ancestors.
This talk goes
through the
different ways
Tamagotchis
can be
tampered with
through these
channels. It
describes a
method of
achieving code
execution on a
Tamagotchi
though a flash
accessory,
using this to
dump the
Tamagotchi's
internal ROM,
and the
internal
Tamagotchi
'secrets' it
revealed. It
also covers
the
development
tools I've
written for
the Tamagotchi
and includes
some
demonstrations
of modified
Tamagotchis.
