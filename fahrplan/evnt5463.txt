Satellites in
Low Earth
Orbit have
tons of nifty
signals, but
they move
quickly though
the sky and
are difficult
to track with
fine accuracy.
This lecture
describes a
remotely
operable
satellite
tracking
system that
the author
built from a
Navy-surplus
Inmarsat dish
in Southern
Appalachia.

The entire
system is
controlled
through a
Postgres
database, fed
by various
daemons spread
across
multiple
machines.  So
when I click
on a satellite
on my laptop
or cellphone,
it runs
"UPDATE target
SET
name='Voyager
1';" and the
motor daemon
then begins to
track the new
target while
the prediction
daemon
maintains
accurate
estimates of
its position
in the sky.
Additional
daemons take
spectral
prints or
software-
defined radio
recordings of
the targeted
object for
later review.
