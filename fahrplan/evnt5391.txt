Y U NO ISP,
taking back
the Net

Building and
running an ISP
is not that
difficult.
It's hard to
say how many
people are
connected to
the Internet
by such weird
structures,
but we know
that they are
more and more
each day. What
is at stake is
taking back
the control of
the Internet
infrastructure
and showing
that a neutral
Internet
access is
natural.  Y U
NO ISP
Providing
access to the
Internet seems
complicated
but it's
actually quite
simple. You
have to roll
up your
sleeves, dig a
lot into
legal,
commercial and
administrative
stuff.
Surprisingly,
the technical
part is
usually not a
problem.
Despite what
you could
think, there
is no need for
a big infrastr
ucture, a lot
of money, or
that sort of
thing.
Benjamin
Bayart is at
the head of
the non-profit
organization
FDN the oldest
ISP still in
activity in
France. In
2010, he
called for the
swarming of
the concepts
behind FDN.
The idea was
to copy
locally what
FDN was doing
at a country
scale and
spread the
word about
self-hosting,
Net neutrality
and the stakes
for society.
The call was
followed by
the creation
of several
non-profit
organizations,
quickly
federated in a
meta-structure
called FFDN,
for Federation
FDN.  2 years
later, FFDN is
much bigger.
From 7 orgs,
there are now
21, counting
around 1 400
members. A
human network
above the
machine's one.
From the
beginning, we
knew that we
were not alone
and in the
meantime we
met with
similar
organizations
around the
world, like
the Free
Network
Fundation in
the USA or
Guifi in
Spain. We
launched an
international
mailing list
to spread the
recipes for
building open
and neutral
access to the
Internet in
many
situations.
During OHM,
this talk
helped
federating
energies
around a
belgium
project and we
hope 30C3 will
be the
occasion to
spread the
word even
more, maybe to
give some
ideas and
plant some
seeds for
building a
better
Internet.
After all, Y U
NO TRY ?
