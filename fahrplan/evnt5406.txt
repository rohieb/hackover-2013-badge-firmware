Autonomous
flying
vehicles,
where are we
and where are
we going?

During the
last 10 years
the technology
that was
formerly only
available to
the military,
reached the
hands of
thousands.
Researchers,
hackers,
enthusiasts
and hobbyists
helped drive
the technology
further and
higher than
anyone had
imagined just
a few years
ago. We will
recap what the
civilian
airborne robot
community has
achieved in
the last
decade and
what the next
frontiers are
that need to
be addressed.
Over the last
decade,
projects and
companies like
Paparazzi,
Microdrone,
AscTec,
Mikrokopter,
UAVP-NG and
others have
made small
unmanned
vehicles (aka.
drones) what
they are
today. Through
innovation and
hard work,
autonomous
drones are now
affordable and
accessible
enough that
most of us can
build one at
home. While
the companies
inspired, the
Open-Source
projects
advanced and
shared these m
ultidisciplina
ry
technologies
with many
engineers and
hackers
thereby
building a
collaborative
community of
innovators
from the
ground up.
Though many
challenges
have been
overcome, we
are only at
the very
beginning of
the private
UAV
revolution.
Consider a
comparison
with the
personal
computer,
which has
evolved in
ways that
could not be
foreseen in
the beginning.
Those working
on this
platform need
space and time
to discover
the beneficial
possibilities.
There are many
challenges
that we are
still facing
and they are
as exciting
and basic as
the technology
itself.   Let
me take you
through a
brief history
of the
developments
and advances
in Open-Source
UAV and try to
envision what
is still in
front of us.
