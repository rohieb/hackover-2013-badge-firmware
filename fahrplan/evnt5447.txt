Policing the
Romantic Crowd

Velocipedes
and Face
Recognition
--------------
MaTu

Track: Ethics,
Society &
Politics

This talk
considers the
use of new
technology to
police large
crowds in the
Romantic
period. We
examine
ethical
aspects of
modern
surveillance
technologies
by looking at
debates around
crowd control
and face
recognition in
the age that
first
imagined, and
reflected on,
the
surveillance
state.  1819
saw a craze in
Britain for
German
mechanic Karl
Von Drais's
Laufmaschine -
a two-wheeled,
peddleless
wooden
precursor of
the bicycle
dubbed
"velocipede"
or "dandy
charger". As
well as
recreational
uses, military
and police
applications
were quickly
proposed for
this
futuristic
technology. On
1 September
1819, The
Tickler
magazine
imagined
squadrons of
"Dandy
Dragoons"
being used to
police "public
spectacles".
There was a
serious point
beneath the
humour. Just
two weeks
earlier,
brutal
policing by
soliders on
horseback led
to the deaths
of protestors
at a public
meeting that
became known
as the
Peterloo
Massacre. We
consider the
Drais-maschine
as a "hacked
horse", but
one that
caused public
anxiety as
well as
fashionable
interest. We
consider
Romantic
debates around
the proposed
use of
velocipedes
for "home
service",
since they
strikingly
anticipate
contemporary
discussions
about drone
deployment in
homeland
security
contexts. We
ask what light
these early
debates throw
on our own
misgivings
about the
"teching-up"
of
surveillance
agencies.  We
look at two
"public
spectacles" in
the Romantic
period. The
first is the
"Triumphant
Entry into
London" on 13
September 1819
of popular
radical
politician
Henry Hunt to
answer treason
charges
following his
participation
at Peterloo.
The poet John
Keats was
among the
30,000-strong
crowd who
lined the
streets to
welcome him,
and from his
letters we
have an
eyewitness
account. The
second -
related -
"public
spectacle" is
imagined in a
painting
entitled
"Christ's
Triumphant
Entry into
Jerusalem" by
Keats's friend
B. R. Haydon.
Haydon
included
Keats's face
in the crowd,
as well as
those of other
poets and
philosophers,
including
Voltaire and
Newton.
Critics of the
painting
referred to
the "gross
anachronism"
of their
presence - in
another sense,
though, they
are merely in
the wrong
place, at the
wrong time
(Zur falschen
Zeit am
falschen Ort).
Both
spectacles
offer a bridge
to a
consideration
of ethical
aspects to C21
surveillance
technology.
The final part
of our talk
focuses on
Romanticism's
understanding
of the
interpretive
role of face
recognition.
Modern
software
promises to
turn facial
features into
objective,
mathematical
space, though
arguably fails
to move beyond
the subjective
heuristic
space into
which viewers
of Haydon's
canvas were
invited two
hundred years
ago. Modern
face-tracking
software's act
of recognition
is always an
act of
imagining the
subject's
relation to
wrong-doing.
The identified
face in the
crowd summons
his or her
"unenrolled"
Doppelgänger,
where
individuals
occupy a
quantum-like
state of
uncertainty
until a
measurement is
made against a
crime - a
problem to
which Haydon's
painting seems
supremely
attuned.  The
talk as a
whole builds
on our
previous
exploration at
29C3 of ways
in which post-
Enlightenment
art, poetry
and political
philosophy is
relevant to
C21
discussions
about
surveillance
culture.  °°°°
