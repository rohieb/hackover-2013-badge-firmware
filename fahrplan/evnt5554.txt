We present
Magic Lantern,
a free open
software add-
on for Canon
DSLR cameras,
that offers
increased
functionality
aimed mainly
at DSLR pro
and power
users. It runs
alongside
Canon's own
firmware and
introduces to
consumer-grade
DSLRs features
usually only
found in
professional
high-end
digital
(cinema)
cameras.  With
downloads in
excess of half
a million and
tens of
thousands of
registered
users, Magic
Lantern has
become one of
the largest
examples of
collaborative
efforts of
users hoping
to get the
most out of
their
devices... by
hacking them.
Being a free,
open source
non-commercial
project
developed by
enthusiasts,
Magic Lantern
is not
endorsed by
Canon in any
way.  Apart
from giving an
introduction
of the project
and it's
collaborative
structure, the
talk will
present a live
demonstration
of Magic
Lantern,
focusing
mainly on DSLR
video work,
it's
challenges,
and practical
day-to-day use
of the unique
functionality
offered by
Magic Lantern,
like RAW 2.5k
14 bit video
recording and
workflow, live
audio
monitoring, as
well as
display
enhancements
like focus
peaking,
zebras,
histogram and
waveform
assist tools.
Although the
talk will
focus on
compatible
Canon cameras,
it will
present a
solid,
practical
overview for
any user
interested in
both the
positive and
negative
aspects of
using modern
DSLR cameras
for
professional
video and
cinematography
work.
