Software-
Defined Radio
(SDR) has
increased in
popularity in
recent years
due to the
decrease in
hardware costs
and increase
in processing
power. One
example of
such a class
of devices is
the RTL-SDR
USB dongles
based on the
Realtek
RTL2832U
demodulator.
This talk will
discuss my
experience in
building a
distributed RF
scanner array
for monitoring
and spectrum
mapping using
such cheap SDR
devices. The
goal is to
help the
audience
understand the
what, why, and
how of
building their
own RF
monitoring
array so that
they will be
able to do it
themselves. In
this era of
increasingly
being
``watched'',
we must be
prepared to do
our own
``watching''.

This work
investigates
building and
running an RF
scanner array
for monitoring
and spectrum
mapping using
cheap SDR
devices. The
array allows
for both RF
sampling and
power analysis
to be split
over multiple
systems in
order to
increase
capture and
spectrum
analysis
capabilities.
The system
allows for
"strong signal
capture" as
well as,
simply, signal
modeling with
"strong signal
alerting".
Also discussed
will be using
the array
versus USRPs
and the issue
of antennae
for all of the
devices. I
will explain
the mistakes I
made in
building the
array and what
I did to
attempt
toovercome
such pitfalls.
The code for
running the
array will be
introduced and
released for
public
consumption.
In addition,
while we
target the
RTL-SDR
devices, we
will discuss
the
feasibility of
including non-
traditional
SDR hardware
in the array,
including non-
Realtek tuner
cards and
inclusion of
HackRF
devices.
