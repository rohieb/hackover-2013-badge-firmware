A Butoh Dance
raising from
the raw
material
portraying the
mitology of
Mate!  Since
our first Mate
harvest in
2009, we have
been
performing the
indigenous
Guarani
mythology of
the Mate
Goddess
Caayari in a
Butoh context.
This
performance
has been
readapted for
the context of
the Congress,
reinforcing
how the
connecting and
communication
aspects of
Mate help
hackers on the
data highway
to focus and
make
synergies.
Once upon a
time an ailing
Guarani Indian
left behind by
his tribe
discovered a
plant that
rejuvenated
him and made
him feel young
again. This
magical drink
that he made
from the
leaves of the
Mate Tree took
on the spirit
of the Goddess
Caayari who
kept him
company in his
solitude and
gave him
strength and
inspiration.
From flashing
back to the
mate
mythology,
forward to
30C3, Mate
today plays a
different
role, captured
in a bottle
and beloved by
hackers who
drink mate to
concentrate
and connect on
the Net. Just
as the Guarani
tribes used to
drink Mate
together a
long time ago
around the
fire and
exchange
information,
and South
American
communities
come together
to pass a mate
cuia around;
today Mate
plays a vital
role in the
social aspect
of gatherings
such as the
Congress.
Raven and
Fabricio do
Canto have
performed the
Caayari
mythology for
audiences in
India and
Lebanon, and
more recently,
Fabricio has
integrated
parts from the
performance
into his Mate
lectures.
Their expressi
onistic
interpretation
of the origins
of the Caayari
Mate Mythology
will be
followed by a
Mate Circle.
