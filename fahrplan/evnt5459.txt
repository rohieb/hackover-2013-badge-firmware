Track:
Security &
Safety

In the chain
of trust of
most secure
schemes is an
electronic
chip that
holds secret
information.
These schemes
often employ c
ryptographical
ly secure
protocols. The
weakest link
of such a
scheme is the
chip itself.
By attacking
the chip
directly an
attacker can
gain access to
the secret
data in its
unencrypted
form. In this
presentation
we demonstrate
the attack
class of the
future,
backside
attacks. This
class of
attacks
mitigate all
device counter
measures and
can access all
signals of the
device. As
opposed to the
attacks of
today, these
attacks can
also be
applied to
complex
systems such
as the ARM
SoCs of modern
smartphones.
Over recent
years hackers
and chip
manufacturers
have been
deadlocked in
the field of
integrated
circuit
security. From
reverse
engineering
proprietary
cryptographic
algorithms and
microprobing
bus lines to
fault
injection and
side cannel
attacks, every
class of
attack has
ushered in new
preventative c
ountermeasures
. Most attacks
to date are
performed from
the frontside
where all the
active areas
and circuit
nodes are
accesible.
Hence, all cou
ntermeasures,
such as
shields and
meshes, also
focus on
mitigating
attacks from
the frontside.
Security
relevant
signals are
burried under
many layers of
metalization
to make them
inaccessible
to frontside
attackers. The
direct
consequence is
that backside
attacks become
significantly
more
appealing.
With comprably
little effort,
many old-
school attacks
are once again
possible.
Setting or
resetting
fuses, probing
wires or even
single
transistors is
possible, not
only with
needles but
with electron
beams or
lasers. More
exotic attacks
are feasible
from the
backside as
well. For
example, in
switching
transistors
some of the
electrons
induce photons
that can be
seen with an
infrared
camera during
execution. The
opposite, i.e.
iducing laser
light, can
also result in
successful
glitching
attacks.
Currently,
there are is
little IC
vendors can do
to prevent
such attacks.
