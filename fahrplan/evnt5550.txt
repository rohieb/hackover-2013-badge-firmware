Beyond the
Tech: Building
Internet
Freedom Tools
for Real
People
--------------
Michael
Brennan

Track: Science
& Engineering

Few hackers
will disagree
that users are
not given
enough
consideration
when building
Internet
Freedom Tools
designed to
circumvent
censorship and
surveillance.
But how do we
do it? This
talk will
outline a
framework for
a user-focused
approach to
the
Development
and Impact of
Internet
Freedom Tools
through using
ethnography,
human-centered
design, and
the practice
of research-
based product
definition.
This talk is
intended for
developers,
researchers,
and
journalists
who seek to
understand how
better tools
can be
developed to
protect
anonymity and
provide
unfettered
access to the
Internet.
Internet
Freedom Tools
(IFTs) are
developed to
solve the
technical
challenges of
anonymity,
privacy,
security and
information
access. Focus
on these
technical
challenges
rather than
the user of an
IFT can lead
to overlooking
the
motivations,
needs and
usability
issues faced
by user
communities.
Further, IFTs
may solve a
technical
challenge for
users, and yet
fall short
when it comes
to user
experience.
There is a
disconnect
that must be
remedied for
IFTs and the
people who use
them to
realize their
full
potential.
This talk
seeks to
provide new
insights to
developers and
users in need
of knowledge
on how they
can better
address
relevant
problems,
create
appropriate
solutions and
help users
with IFTs.
This talk will
explain to the
audience what
tools are
available for
user-focused
design. It
will also walk
through a
framework to
guide the
development of
IFTs that is
grounded in
ethnographic
methods and
human-centered
design, and
how this
framework is
being used to
conduct an IFT
user
community.
This work is
currently
being
conducted by
SecondMuse and
Radio Free
Asia through
the Open
Technology
Fund (www.open
techfund.org).
ADDENDUM: But,
what is
"Ethnography"?
What are "User
Communities"?
Ethnography is
defined as the
study of
culture and
human
motivation
through
qualitative
research.
Ethnographic
practices
complement
usability
studies by
tapping into
needs and
motivations of
people and
users to give
the "why"
behind certain
actions
observed
solely through
conducting
usability
research. This
method
includes
interviews,
observing
specific
behaviors and
understanding
the material
culture and
surrounds of a
target group.
A community is
defined as a
group of users
that can be
defined by
geography,
culture,
shared
experiences,
or shared
challenges.
User is
defined as
someone who is
currently
utilizing a
particular
IFTs such as
Tor, RedPhone,
CryptoCat,
and/or other
privacy,
security,
anonymity and
access
enhancing
technologies
and
methodologies
created by
developers or
users
themselves. A
user may also
be defined as
a potential
user of such
technologies
and tools.
