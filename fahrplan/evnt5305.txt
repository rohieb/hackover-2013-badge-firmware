Breaking
Baryons

On the
Awesomeness of
Particle
Accelerators
and Colliders
--------------
Michael Büker

Track: Science
& Engineering

A light-
hearted
presentation
about many
aspects of
particle
accelerators
like the LHC
and their
particle
collision
experiments.
Aimed at
technically
interested
non-scientists
and physics
buffs alike.
When the Large
Hadron
Collider went
into operation
in 2008, many
people around
the world
(re)discovered
an interest in
particle
physics and
collision
experiments.
If you are
reading this,
particle
accelerators
have not
destroyed the
world yet,
giving us a
chance to talk
about them.
Particle
accelerators
and collision
experiments
touch on many
fascinating
aspects of
technology and
physics that
are far
removed from
our usual
experiences:
vast machines,
high
precision,
huge energies,
enormous
volumes of
data, tiny
lifetimes and
ultra-rare
occurences.
This talk
wants to
entertain and
surprise with
insights into
the workings
of particle
accelerators,
the
instruments
used to make
discoveries
and the
techniques
used for
learning from
their results.
The talk is
supposed to be
enjoyable for
the
scientifically
versed as well
as the
technically
inclined or
the interested
observer. No
physics
background
necessary!
