Hacking as
Artistic
Practice

!Mediengruppe
Bitnik about
their recent
works
--------------
!Mediengruppe
Bitnik

Track: Art &
Beauty

!Mediengruppe
Bitnik are
contemporary
artists. In
their talk
they will show
two examples
of their work,
illustrating
the
translation of
hacking from
the computer
field into an
artistic
practice.
Bitnik will
show how to
hack the opera
in ten easy
steps and what
happens when
you send a
parcel with a
hidden live
webcam to
Julian Assange
at the
Ecuadorian
Embassy in
London.
Using the
strategies of
hacking,
!Mediengrupppe
Bitnik
intervenes
into settings
with the aim
of opening
them up to re-
evaluation and
new
perspectives.
«Opera
Calling» was
an artistic
intervention
into the
cultural
system of the
Zurich Opera.
From March 9th
to May 26th
2007, audio
bugs, hidden
in the
auditorium,
transmitted
the
performances
of the Zurich
Opera to
randomly
selected
telephone
land-lines in
the city of
Zurich. In
proper style
of a home-
delivery-
service,
anyone who
picked up
their
telephone, was
able to listen
to the on-
going opera
performances
for as long as
s/he wanted
through a live
connection
with the audio
bug signal.
The Zurich
Opera launched
a search for
the bugs and
in a first
reaction
threatened to
take legal
action if the
transmissions
were not
stopped and
the bugs not
removed.
«Delivery for
Mr. Assange»
is a live mail
art piece. In
January 2013
!Mediengruppe
Bitnik sent
Wikileaks-
Founder Julian
Assange a
parcel
containing a
camera. Julian
Assange has
been living in
the center of
a diplomatic
crisis at the
Ecuadorian
embassy in
London since
June 2012.
Through a hole
in the parcel,
the camera
documented and
live-tweeted
its journey
through the
postal system,
letting anyone
online follow
the parcel's
status in
real-time.
!Mediengruppe
Bitnik regard
this work as a
SYSTEM_TEST.
Would the
parcel reach
its intended
destination?
Or would it be
removed from
the postal
system?
