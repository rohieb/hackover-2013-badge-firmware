Security &
Safety

Increasingly,
users and
their
computing
hardware are
exposed a
range of
software and
hardware
attacks,
ranging from
disk imaging
to hardware
keylogger
installation
and beyond.
Existing
methods are
inadequate to
fully protect
users,
particularly
from covert
physical
hardware
modifications
in the "evil
maid"
scenario, and
yet are very
inconvenient.
Victims
include
governments
and
corporations
traveling inte
rnationally
(e.g. China),
anti-
government
activists in
places like
Syria, and
anyone who is
a target of a
motivated
attacker who
can gain
physical
access.
Physically
Unclonable
Functions,
combined with
a trusted
mobile device
and a network
service, can
be used to
mitigate these
risks. We
present a
novel open-
source mobile
client and
network
service which
can protect
arbitrary
hardware from
many forms of
covert
modification
and attack,
and which when
integrated
with software,
firmware, and
policy
defenses, can
provide
greater
protection to
users and
limit
potential
attack
surface.
Additional
Notes for our
talk:  1) The
attack
addressed is
an entire
class of
hardware,
firmware, and
software
attacks around
the attacker
gaining
surreptitious
access and
modification
(of hardware/f
irmware/softwa
re) on one or
more
occasions,
followed by
the authorized
user making
normal use of
the device
after these
modifications.
A software-
only attack
can be
addressed
through
"trusted boot"
or "measured
boot" systems
(e.g. what TCG
does).
Firmware
attacks are
generally not
addressed by
most measured
boot
processes, but
that's just an
implementation
problem. The
most novel
category of
attack is
defeating the
addition of
hardware
components or
modification
of hardware
components,
which becomes
a desirable
attack once so
ftware/firmwar
e are locked
down.  One
scenario is
that an
investor flies
to China with
a laptop and a
cellphone and
intends to
remain in the
country for
several weeks,
conducting
business
online as well
as in person.
On several
occasions, the
investor
leaves his
laptop in his
hotel room,
while taking
his cellphone
with him at
all times.
Adversary
agents, as
hotel staff,
enter the room
and make
modifications
to hardware,
with the
intent of
circumventing
either local
software
protections
(cloning
drives,
capturing pass
phrases, etc.)
or subverting
network
resources
later
accessed,
either while
the investor
remains in
China or after
he returns to
the home
office with
the laptop.
In-depth
physical
analysis of
the hardware,
conducted at
home base, can
often discover
hardware
modifications.
Best current
practice is to
quarantine
"travel"
machines and
never allow
them back on
high security
networks.
Unfortunately,
this leaves
the user
exposed for
the entire
duration of a
single trip --
in some
situations the
entire
transaction
happens during
a trip, so all
sensitive
information
must be
protected for
that trip.
PUFs and our
network
verification
can be used to
effectively
"sign"
hardware in
the field in a
way which can
be
automatically
verified and
verified
interactively
with a "home
base" network
service. This
lets network
resources be
protected
continuously;
before every
access, the
client
device's
integrity can
be checked and
attested.  An
interesting
strategy is to
not travel
with any
sensitive
hardware
(beyond the
cellphone) and
buy random
laptops at the
destination,
enroll them in
the service
while at the
destination,
provision them
with services,
and ensure no
subsequent
unauthorized h
ardware/firmwa
re/software
changes can be
made, using
the same
system.  2)
PUFs  The PUFs
are functions
which can't be
(tractably)
cloned.
Unfortunately,
virtually none
of these can
be inspected/v
erified/attest
ed directly by
an unaided
human --
anything which
is a simple
serial number
seal or other
human-
verifiable
thing can be
fairly
trivially
counterfeited.
The PUFs make
use of large
amounts of
random and
changing data,
created
through
physically
random
processes
which are
impossible to
(tractably)
reproduce. The
innovation is
to use a
user's
cellphone and
a network
service as the
verifier --
the phone can
remain in the
user's
physical
custody at all
times, and by
splitting the
verification
between the
phone (on site
with the user)
and a network
service acting
as gatekeeper
to protected
network
resources, the
system can be
protected from
various
attacks.  The
PUFS that we
take advatage
of are that of
the physical
systems
themselves.
When a device
is created
during
manufacture a
multitude of
processes are
utilized to
produce the
compute
device. As it
turns out repr
oducibility on
the sub
millimetre
scale of a
identical
compenents
such as a
laptop case is
excessively
difficult to c
lone/counterfi
t/interact
with without
disturbing the
previous
state. We take
advantage of
these flaws to
aid the user
in detecting
modification
to their
computing
devices
through
photography
and other
standard low
cost tamper
evidencing
devices which
a untrained
user can
deploy in the
field.  Clear
technical
documentation
w/ photos
explaining why
it is
incredibly
difficult with
current attack
methods to
perfectly
clone
manufactured
parts which on
the surface
are indistingu
ishable from
another
manufactured
assembly.
