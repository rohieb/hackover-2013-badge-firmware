Sysadmins of
the world,
unite!

a call to
resistance
--------------
Julian
Assange, Jacob

Track: Ethics,
Society &
Politics

<p>Finally,
the world is
aware of the
threat of mass
surveillance
and control,
but we still
have a fight
on our hands,
and that fight
is both
technical and
political.
Global
democracy is
not going to
protect
itself. There
has never been
a higher
demand for a
politically-
engaged
hackerdom.
Jacob
Appelbaum and
Julian Assange
discuss what
needs to be
done if we are
going to
win.</p>
<p>The first
part of this
talk will
discuss the
WHAT? and the
WHY?: the
historical
challenge we
face, and how
we are called
to resistance.
</p>
<blockquote>We
are living in
a defining
historical
moment.  In
recent years,
the network
has created an
unprecedented
capacity for
parallel
communication
and action.
This has
changed the
world. For
decades
hackers have
known of the
growth of a
surveillance
state at the
heart of
Western
democracies.
Now, everyone
knows, and we
are left with
a single
question, how
do we stop
this?
Hackers,
sysadmins,
developers and
people of a
technical
persuasion are
neither
neutral
parties nor
spectators to
this. We built
the internet
and we keep it
running. We
live there. We
write the
code. We
manage the
networks.
Communications
hegemony is
impossible
without the
obedience of
the people who
build and run
the system.
Our network
has become the
nervous system
of the world.
We must wake
up to this. We
must realize
the power and
responsibility
we hold for
the great
structural
problems of
our time. This
year, Edward
Snowden showed
that we are
not powerless.
We all face a
moral choice
whether to
collude or to
resist. We
say, resist!
Sysadmins of
the world, uni

e>  <p>In the
second half of
this talk we
will discuss
the HOW?: the
medium term
and long term
modes of
action around
which we must
organize, if
we are to see
meaningful
resistance
against the
global counter
intelligence
state, and
meaningful
progress
towards
emancipation.
