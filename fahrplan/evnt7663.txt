How to build a
pinball
machine? We
introduce you
to all basics
and explain
the different
options for
hardware and
software. As
an example, we
show images of
our own custom
pinball
machine.  This
talk gives an
overview over
all the
components in
a pinball
machine which
includes
software and a
lot of
hardware.
Afterwards, we
go over all
the steps when
designing and
building a
pinball
machine. We
start with
basic design
rules,
physical
limits and
best
practices.
Then, we focus
on the
mechanical and
electronic
components.
After that, we
talk about
software and
display (DMD
vs LCD)
options. At
the end, we
explain how to
build or
manufacture
certain parts
for your
machine.  For
the hardware,
we talk about:
- EM, WPC and
modern
machines -
Coils and
Switches -
Sources for

elements -
Gi/Lamps - RGB
LEDs - Display
