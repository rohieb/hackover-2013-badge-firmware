Track:
Security &
Safety

In this talk
(which in part
was delivered
at Infiltrate
2013 and
NoSuchCon
2013) we will
discuss our
recent
research that
is being
rolled into
our Practical
ARM
Exploitation
course (sold
out at
Blackhat this
year and last)
on Linux and
Android (for
embedded
applications
and mobile
devices). We
will also
demonstrate
these
techniques and
discuss how we
were able to
discover them
using several
ARM hardware
development
platforms that
we custom
built.  Where
relevant we
will also
discuss ARM
exploitation
as it related
to Android as
we wrote about
in the
"Android
Hackers
Handbook"
which we co-
authored and
will be
released in
October 2013.
Lastly, we
will also
discuss some
of our most
recent related
hardware
research (to
facilitate the
above) which
will include
bus protocol e
avesdropping/r
everse
engineering,
demystifying
hardware
debugging, and
surreptitiousl
y obtaining
embedded
software
(firmware)
using hardware
techniques. We
will
demonstrate
and show the
supportive
tools used and
techniques
developed to
perform this
work and
deploy them
against Apple
MFI iAP
devices, and
multimedia
devices using
OEM
implemented
USB stacks.
(Which will
briefly
include our
experiences
around
starting
http://int3.cc
where we sell
a fully
assembled
modified
version of a
hardware USB
fuzzer.)
Along the way
we will
inevitably
share some of
the lessons we
also learned
while
completely
designing the
hardware (from
scratch),
writing the
firmware, and
mobile apps
for an
embedded
security
device called
Osprey that we
hold the
patent for and
have been
publicly about
publicly as a
hardware
vulnerability
assessment
swiss-army-
knife for
researchers.
