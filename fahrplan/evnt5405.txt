Track: Ethics,
Society &
Politics

For over
thirty years,
human rights
groups in
Guatemala have
carefully
documented the
killing and
disappearance
of many people
in the early
1980s. There
are tens of
thousands of
records in
many
databases, and
over 80
million paper
pages of
police records
available in
the Archives
of the
National
Police. Most
of the
prosecutions
of the former
military and
police
officials who
committed the
atrocities
depends on
eyewitnesses,
specific
documents, and
forensic anthr
opologists'
examination of
exhumed bones.
However, data
analysis helps
to see the big
patterns in
the violence.
This talk will
explain how
data analysis
illuminated
the selective
patterns among
mass killings
in the
prosecution
for genocide
of former de
facto
President
General José
Efraín Ríos
Montt. The
talk will also
explain how
looking at the
communications
metadata from
over 20,000
randomly
sampled paper
memos helped
illuminate
command
patterns in a
disappearance
case.
