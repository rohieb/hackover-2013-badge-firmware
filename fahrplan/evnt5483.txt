Talk
introducing
NSTIC and COM
238, i.e. the
current
digital
identity
policy
proposals in
the USA and
European
discussing
their
similarities,
differences
and possible
conflicts.  In
the past two
years both the
US Government
as well as the
European
Commission
have declared
their intend
to create
"Identity
Ecosystems"
and are
actively
pursuing the
creation of
regulatory and
technical
frameworks for
digital
authentication
of their
citizens. Both
the USA and
the European
Union expect
the
implementation
of state-
recognized
digital
identities in
the coming
three to five
years.  The
American
initiative is
called
"National
Strategy for
Trusted
Identities in
Cyberspace
(NSTIC), its
European
counterpart
"electronic
identification
and trust
services for
electronic
transactions
in the
internal
market"
(COM(2012)
238).   Given
the scope of
these
programs, the
number of
people
affected and
the fact that
identity
technologies
necessarily
have to
negotiate
conflicting
values of
individual
liberty and
social
control, it is
reasonable to
expect that
the
developments
around NSTIC
and COM (2012)
238 will
become
dominant in
the debate on
the future of
the Internet.
In my talk I
will introduce
the basics of
the White
Houses NSTIC
initiative and
the European
Unions
COM(2012) 238,
explaining the
common traits
as well as the
conflicting
aspects of the
electronic
identity
programs of
two of the
worlds largest
and most
influential
state
entities.   I
will outline
how both
programs share
the assumption
that providing
"secure" and
"trusted"
identities is
essential for
the future
development of
the Internet,
is necessary
to fully
realize
citizenship
status on the
Net as well as
to foster
further
economic
growth. I will
also
scrutinize the
importance and
function of
the term
"transaction"
that is
prominent in
both NSTIC and
COM (2012)
238.
Subsequently I
will show that
NSTIC and COM
(2012) 238
differ
fundamentally
in their view
on the role of
the state, of
the private
sector and of
civil society
in providing
and
controlling
the standards,
protocols and 
infrastructure
s of digital
identities.
Here I will
outline how
the NSTIC
employs a
neoliberal
market
rhetoric,
declaring that
"the Identity
Ecosystem
should be
market-
driven" while
the European
Union follows
an etaistic
vision of
governmental
identity
provision. In
this context I
will show the
importance of
the different
approaches
between Europe
and the USA
concerning the
relation of
existing
offline and
online
identity
solutions.
The goal of
the talk is to
raise
awareness to
the importance
of these
programs, to
enable an
understanding
of the
paradoxes of
digital
identity
provision and
its function
in both
enabling and
sustaining
statehood and
capitalism.
The talk will
close with a
statement
locating the
differences
between the
European and
the United
States
approach in
the larger
conflict on
the question
of means and
legitimacy of
intervening
and regulating
capitalism.
