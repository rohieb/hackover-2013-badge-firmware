With the
disappearance
of the
computer,
something else
is silently
becoming
invisible as
well - the
User. Users
are
disappearing
as both
phenomena and
term, and this
development is
either
unnoticed or
accepted as
progress - an
evolutionary
step. Though
the Invisible
User is more
of an issue
than an
Invisible
Computer.
