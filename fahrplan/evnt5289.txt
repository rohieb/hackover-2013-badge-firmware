Coding your
body

How to
decipher the
messages of
your body
--------------
Sophie Hiltner

Track: Science
& Engineering

The average
movement
habits of a
clichè hacker
are legendary.
Cowering for
days in front
of unergonomic
hardware
setups, stoic
ignorance of
hardly
decodeable
signs of the
body like
hunger, eye-
and backpains.
Probably due
to a general
disinterest in
non-digitally
engineered
systems.
Shouldn't a
true hacker
know at least
bits and
pieces about
the codes and
signs of the
body? We all
know bits and
pieces.. but
are they the
correct and
helpful ones?
We will
discuss some
technical and
biological
details of
slipped discs,
posture
disservice and
pain. I will
show
fundamental
"red flags"
which have to
be serviced by
a medical
geek. But not
all medical
geeks have a
good idea
about the
body's code,
therefore I
will also
suggest some
helpful
therapies for
the most
common cases.
Bottom line:
how to code
your body to
prevent pain
without
relying on
smattering.  I
am a trained
physical
therapist and
have treated
many patients
with different
back problems,
which were
mostly caused
by the same
habits:
ignorance of
warning signs,
bad hardware
setup and
cluelessness
about how the
body
functions. My
talk will
include basic
models of the
important body
structures and
how basic
maintanance
should look
like. I will
focus on the
vertebral
setup with
bone and
connective
tissues. How
are they build
and what their
function is.
I will also
present some
worst case
scenarios of
consequences
when slipped
discs cut of
nerves and
numbness in
arms or legs
are mild
problems you
might
encounter.
Small changes
in posture and
daily habits
will be
presented,
because you
have to know
why and how
you should do
it.
