Glass Hacks

Fun and
frightening
uses of
always-on
camera enabled
wearable
computers

Stephen
Balaban

Track: Science
& Engineering

A one hour
technical
lecture that
covers
everything
from machine
learning and
AI to hardware
design and
manufacture.
Includes
demonstrations
of
applications
enabled by an
always-on
image
capturing
wearable
computer.
You'll leave
with a clear
understanding
of the field's
status quo,
how we got
here, and
insight into
what's around
the corner.
Always-on
camera enabled
wearable
computers,
like Google
Glass and
Lambda Hat,
enable a
variety of
slightly
creepy, but
undeniably
useful
applications.
For the past
few months,
I've worn a
computing
device that
takes pictures
every few
seconds. I run
facial
detection over
the image
stream,
pulling out
every face I
have seen.
Soon, we'll be
able to
conduct mass
facial
recognition
using this
data. Other
applications
include
detecting
license plates
and
automatically
uploading them
to a public
GPS tagged
website.  This
talk will
cover the
history, state
of the art,
and future of
wearable
computing,
machine
learning, and
the privacy
implication of
this
technology.
