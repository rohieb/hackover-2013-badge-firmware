Track: Ethics,
Society &
Politics

After studying
the various
levels of
activities
that come
together in
BuggedPlanet
and realizing
the scope and
level of
implementation
of NSA´s
SIGINT
theatre, it´s
propably time
to step back,
summarize the
big picture
and ask how we
handle it
properly.  The
talk will be
structured in
three parts:
Part 1:
Technical
Abilities &
Affected Areas
Technologies
of
surveillance, 
telecommunicat
ion
interception
and SIGINT, cr
yptoanalytics,
cryptocircumve
ntion and what
areas of data
processing
must be
considered
practically
targeted and
compromised.
Part 2: What
this means for
governments,
societies,
citizens  How
the theory of
democratic
governments,
human rights,
justice and
legal
frameworks are
being affected
by the
interception
and how this
practically
affects the
processes of
governments
and its
players. I
will herefore
give examples
which SIGINT
material is
used in the
form of
Kompromat and
Intelligence
Operations to
influence
decisions and
decision
makers from
different
countries and
continents to
show the
principles and
methods and
how this
impacts
governmental
and other
businesses.
Part 3:
Concepts for
global TSCM
(Technical
Surveillance
Counter
Measures)
What are the
necessary
steps to "de-
bug" our
countries and
how to
immunitize
against
intelligence
propaganda in
order to
achieve data.
This part
shall be a
framework
showing some
ideas and
principles to
act, as well
as necessary
relationships
to understand.
The idea is to
invite the
audience to
participate in
this part and
come up with
ideas to
create a
broader
concept and
agree on the
next steps.
