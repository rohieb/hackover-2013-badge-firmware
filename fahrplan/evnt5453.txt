Against
Metadata

Twisting time
and space to
explore the
unknown

Using case
studies of
documentary
film, Freedom
of Information
Law document
dumps,
soundbanks,
and a hacker
conference, I
will
demonstrate
experiments
and results of
several years
developing
open source
tools to
reorient the
idea of
documentary
around its
documents.
This is in
opposition to
a tendancy
towards
textual and
machine-
readable
metadata,
which unduly
constrain our
wonder,
perception,
and ability to
navigate
ambiguous and
unknown
material.
Snapping a
photo captures
more than just
image data.
Information
about the
camera and its
lens, shutter
speed and
aperture, date
and time, &c,
have been
bundled into
the JPEG since
the early days
of digital
photography.
By now, that
photo is
likely to
include a GPS
trace as well,
and as soon as
it leaves your
camera,
computers are
hard at work
assisting you
in identifying
and tagging
people and
places, with
auto-
completing
textual
clarity and
database
precision.
Meanwhile NSA
spooks try to
reassure us
that they are
only
interested in
the <i>metadat
a</i> of our
communications
--the who and
the when, and
maybe some
keywords.
Without
denying a
power and
efficacy to
machine-
readable
metadata, I
argue that for
humans to
navigate and
find meaning
in unknown and
unsorted
material, this
search will
require multi-
media tools
that immerse
us and augment
our powers of
perception,
rather than
reduce all
navigation to
textfields,
transcripts,
and tags. For
temporal media
(sound and
video), codecs
have given us
greater and
greater
instantaneous
fidelity, but
leave us with
few techniques
to skim, seek,
and survey.
