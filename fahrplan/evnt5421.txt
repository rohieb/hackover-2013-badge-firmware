23rd of
December 2008
was a sad day
in India for
civil
liberties. On
this day, The
Indian
Parliament
passed the
"The
Information
Technology
(Amendment)
Act" with no
debate in the
House, which
effectively
means is that
the government
of India now
has the power
to monitor all
digital
communications
in the country
without a
court order or
a warrant. The
"world's
largest
democracy"
strongly
leaning
towards
becoming a
surveillance
state raises
many questions
and poses
severe
challenges for
free speech
and economic
justice in
India and
globally. This
talk will map
and review the
current
political,
socio-cultural
and legal
landscape of
mass-
surveillance,
data
protection and
censorship in
India and
analyse how it
ties in to the
global
landscape of
surveillance
and
censorship. It
will also aim
to create a
discussion
space to
investigate
the deeper
effects of
these so
called
"welfare"
projects and
how citizen-
led movements
can drive the
state towards
stronger data
protection and
privacy laws.
Section 69 of
the act
states,
"Section 69
empowers the
Central Govern
ment/State
Government/
its authorized
agency to
intercept,
monitor or
decrypt any
information
generated,
transmitted,
received or
stored in any
computer
resource if it
is necessary
or expedient
so to do in
the interest
of the
sovereignty or
integrity of
India, defence
of India,
security of
the State,
friendly
relations with
foreign States
or public
order or for
preventing
incitement to
the commission
of any
cognizable
offence or for
investigation
of any
offence".
What this
effectively
means is that
the government
of India now
has the power
to monitor all
digital
communications
in the country
without a
court order or
a warrant.
Since then,
India has gone
on to setup
several
projects which
leverage
technology to
freely
collect, mine,
share and
commoditize
citizen data,
resulting in a
massive
intelligence
network. These
include the
world's
largest
biometric ID
scheme
(Aadhaar/UID),
the Central
Monitoring
System(CMS),
the Telephone
Call
Interception
System (TCIS),
a DNA data
bank and the
National
Intelligence
Grid
(NATGRID).
The  "world's
largest
democracy"
strongly
leaning
towards
becoming a
surveillance
state raises
many questions
and poses
severe
challenges for
free speech
and economic
justice, not
just in India
but globally.
This talk will
map and review
the current
political,
socio-cultural

landscape of
mass-
surveillance,
