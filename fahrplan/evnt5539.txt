This talk aims
to shed some
light on
recent human
rights
violations in
the context of
the use of
digital
information
and
communications
technology,
particularly
considering
the latest
disclosures
about the
surveillance
programmes of
Western
intelligence
services. At
the same time,
it shall
provide
information
about Amnesty 
International'
s positions
and activities
in this field
and invite
anybody
interested in
our work to
get involved.
In the past 20
years, digital
technologies
have become
widely used in
data
processing and
transmission.
This
phenomenon,
often labelled
as "digital
revolution",
has brought
about great
improvements
in efficiency
in the daily
lives of many
and for
society as a
whole.  The
fight for a
better
protection of
human rights
has also
benefitted
vastly from
these
developments:
It is hard to
imagine that
the "Arab
Spring"
movement could
have gained
the same
momentum
without the
widespread use
of modern
information
and
communications
media.
Classified
documents (the
leaks by
Chelsea
Manning and
Edward Snowden
only being the
most
spectactular
ones) bearing
witness, for
the first
time, to human
rights
violations of
a number of
states,
wouldn't have
seen the same
spread and
publicity
without
anonymous
online
whistleblower
platforms like
WikiLeaks.
Today,
numerous
projects
interconnect
human rights
defenders all
around the
world through
blogs, social
networks,
short
messaging
services and
smartphone
apps. As
networks and
bandwidths
evolve, these
technologies
more and more
enable
activists in
all parts of
the world to
compare notes
on a global
basis,
exchange
information
and
experiences,
upload
evidence of
human rights
violations and
protect
themselves
more
effectively.
On the other
hand,
governments
also use these
technologies
to spy on,
track down and
detain people
that they
believe could
jeopardise
their power.
In many cases,
these measures
affect people
who have
merely
exercised
their human
rights. States
use their
capabilities
to oppress
actions or
opinions they
do not deem
suitable. They
covertly
eavesdrop on
electronic
communications
on a large
scale, thus
undermining
the anonymity
of
communication
and the
privacy of
people. They
block content
or services on
the Internet,
break into
private email
accounts,
censor
opinions
through
gigantic word
filters, or
even shut down
communications
networks in
times of civil
unrest and
political
protests.  The
revelations of
the last
months
concerning the
NSA's and
GCHQ's
surveillance
activities by
far exceed the
dimensions of
global
communications
interception
known to the
public so far.
At the same
time,
whistleblowers
disclosing
classified
information
about human
rights
violations
face severe
persecution by
State
authorities.
The EU
Directive on
blanket teleco
mmunications
data retention
and dubious EU
research
projects like
INDECT add to
the evolving
picture that
it is not just
states with a
well-known
record of
extensive
communications
interception,
filtering and
censoring like
China, Iran or
Saudi Arabia,
that seem to
attach little
value to human
rights in
digital
networks.
These are but
a few examples
of the
ambivalent
impact of
digitisation
on human
rights. While
modern
information
and
communications
technologies
have yielded
new
opportunities
for
individuals to
exercise their
rights, they
have also
given rise to
new ways for
governments to
prevent,
obstruct or
control these
activities
effectively.
Current
developments
show that the
excessive use
of government
power in this
environment
imperils the
full enjoyment
of human
rights, in
particular the
right to
privacy and
the freedom of
expression and
information.
In fact,
governments
all over the
world these
days seem to
engage in what
could be
described as a
repressive
backlash
against the
facilitations
that modern
information
and
communications
technologies
have brought
about for the
exercise of
human rights.
Amnesty Intern
ational's
German section
is currently
setting up a
new task force
(preliminarily
known as Digit
al@Amnesty)
that focuses
on human
rights
violations in
the context of
the use of
digital
information
and
communications
technology.
Our mission is
to keep a
critical eye
on the further
development of
these
technologies
and to assist
in finding a
position on
the issues
arising
thereof with a
view to the
future
protection of
human rights
in a digital
environment.
This talk will
present some
aspects of our
work, the
position
Amnesty takes
on recent
incidents in
this field
(including a
legal
assessment
from a human
rights
perspective),
and ways to
get involved.
